</div>
<p>“How far have we hiked, Elmer, would you say?”</p>
<p>“About twelve miles, at a rough guess, Perk.”</p>
<p>“Huh! then we ought to be close to the ford, where this old river road
crosses to the east shore of the Beaverkill, eh, Elmer?”</p>
<p>“If you listen carefully, Perk, you’ll hear the gurgle of the water
among the stepping stones that lie at the upper edge of Galloway’s
Ford.”</p>
<p>“That’s a fact; and say, I might have noticed it before now, only I was
so busy watching some honey-bees working in the wild flowers alongside
the road, and wondering if we’d be lucky enough to run across their
hive, away up in the top of some hollow tree. Wow! the very idea makes
my mouth water.”</p>
<p>“Well, once across the river and we’ll have about four miles more to
tramp before we can pitch camp; is that O.K., Elmer?”</p>
<p>“A close guess for you, Wee Willie; but over a rough trail instead of
this fairly decent road. Above the ford on this side there’s just a
tote-road leading up to Si. Keck’s deserted lumber camp that lies, you
remember, on the edge of Muskrat Swamp. This road crosses to the other
side, and runs to Crawford Notch, ten miles away.”</p>
<p>“Huh!”</p>
<p>The chap who uttered this last exclamation half belligerently was what
you might call a “horrible example” of the folly often displayed by boys
when clapping a “nick-name” on some unsuspecting comrade.</p>
<p>Really “Wee Willie” was a full head taller than any one of his three
chums, having possibly “shot up” overnight when about fourteen, as often
happens—he was three years past that age now.</p>
<p>Perhaps at one time young Winkleman may have seemed puny and undersized,
so that he really merited the queer sobriquet his mates had fastened
upon him. But nowadays it seemed absolutely ridiculous, and few ever
used it save when accompanied by a whimsical grin that must have become
exceedingly annoying to the tall, angular, sandy-haired and freckled
youth; more especially since he had of late been taking girls to country
barn-dances.</p>
<p>The boy named “Perk,” really Aloysius Green Perkins, a rosy-faced,
genial-looking, and altogether wholesome chap, whom everybody liked,
once more spoke up. He was wheezing, being a bit stout of build, and
frequently mopped his face with a suspiciously dingy-looking red
bandanna; for the summer day had been rather warm, and each fellow
carried quite a weighty pack on his back.</p>
<p>“I’m more than sorry I kept you waiting for me, because I wanted to see
my dad when his train came in; but I had an important message for him,
you know. So I guess it’s my fault if we have to make the last lap of
our big hike after night sets in.”</p>
<p>“We should worry a whole lot about that!” disdainfully chortled the tall
tramper. “Here’s Elmer got his fine pocket flashlight along; and
besides, if we feel like it we can hold up a bit, and wait for the old
moon to come along. She’s due shortly after dark sets in, you remember,
fellows, being just past the full stage.”</p>
<p>“You’ve said it, Wee Willie,” remarked Elmer; “and we ought to be good
for a few more miles.”</p>
<p>“Huh!” grunted the tall chap, just as before, as though the mention of
that name grated on his nerves.</p>
<p>“Sure thing,” assented Perk, sturdily, though at the time it is possible
his plump lower limbs were feeling more or less “wobbly” under him.</p>
<p>“Here’s the ford, and now to cross over,” remarked the fourth member of
the party, Amos Codling by name, who was rather a newcomer in Chester;
though ever since his advent, some six months previous, he and Elmer
Kitching had been fast friends after a sort of David and Jonathan
fashion.</p>
<p>The Beaverkill was not at a high stage, owing to summer droughts, but
made up for this by being unusually noisy at the point where its waters
ran past the “stepping stones,” forming eddies, and pools of
foam-crested water.</p>
<p>The four chums proceeded to cross over. As a rule they were
nimblefooted, and found little trouble in springing from rock to rock.
Once, however, fat Perk came near slipping into the “drink,” when he
made a little miscalculation. However, it happened that wise Elmer had
been “keeping tabs” on the movements of the other, and managed to throw
out a helping hand just in the nick of time.</p>
<p>So at last they reached the other shore. Perk was heard to draw a long
breath as of real relief; for he believed he had just had a narrow
escape from taking an involuntary bath, in which his pack must have been
thoroughly soaked as well as himself.</p>
<p>“Now we leave the Crawford Notch road, and take to the trail that leads
to Log Cabin Bend above here,” announced Elmer, who seemed to be looked
upon as a leader among his mates.</p>
<p>“I reckon now this might be your old trail,” mentioned Wee Willie, as he
pointed indifferently down at his feet.</p>
<p>Elmer agreed with him, for the “signs” were all there. And so without
wasting any time in argument they started off in single file, with Perk
fetching up the rear.</p>
<p>Already the sun was low down, and night could not be far distant. The
trees up in this region were unusually tall, for the lumberman had not
as yet attacked the eastern side of the Beaverkill.</p>
<p>“Say, let me tell you, it’s going to be some gloomy around here pretty
soon,” observed the tall boy, after they had been tramping in this
fashion for at least fifteen minutes, keeping up quite a lively pace.</p>
<p>Amos sighed, as though he might be carrying a little more than his share
of boyish troubles himself; at which Elmer half turned his head to
glance uneasily at his chum; doubtless wondering what it could be that
of late was making the other seem so heavy-hearted.</p>
<p>They continued to plunge along, Elmer setting the pace. Already two of
the four miles had been left behind them, a fact that Perk heard the
leader state with much joy, though he only grunted in his peculiar way.</p>
<p>“Hope you don’t lose touch with this blinky old trail, Elmer,” suggested
Wee Willie, apparently with a motive in view.</p>
<p>“That would be pretty tough on us, for a fact,” chuckled the other; “and
as it’s getting to be something of a strain on my eyes to pick my way, I
reckon it’s time we had a little artificial help.”</p>
<p>With that there immediately sprang into existence a glow from his
electric flashlight that brightly illuminated the forest ahead.</p>
<p>“That’s the ticket!” ejaculated the relieved Perk as they continued to
move along their way, winding in among the aisles of the tall timber,
but in the main keeping toward the north.</p>
<p>“I understand there’s some sort of queer history connected with this old
abandoned cabin at the big bend of the river; do you happen to know
anything about it, Elmer?” asked Amos, presently.</p>
<p>“Oh! I’ve heard some strange things about it,” came the quick reply;
“but I’m not feeling just in the humor to mention any of the same right
now. They’ll keep until some evening, when we’re sitting around the
fire, and spinning yarns.”</p>
<p>“Some of them are just <i>aw</i>ful,” Perk was heard remarking from a little
distance in the rear, for at times he seemed to lag more or less; “but
of course I never take much stock in such old women stories.”</p>
<p>“All the same there <i>was</i> some sort of tragedy took place—” began Wee
Willie, when Elmer stopped him short by saying:</p>
<p>“Drop that, old fellow; we said we’d avoid any and all unpleasant
subjects for to-night, when all of us are feeling a bit tired and
grumpy. Let’s figure out what sort of supper we’d enjoy most when we
arrive. I always look forward to the first meal in camp.”</p>
<p>“And the next one, too,” sighed Perk.</p>
<p>That started them on a congenial topic always deeply absorbing to
healthy and hungry lads; and they continued to lay out a program which,
had it been carried through in its entirety, must have made serious
inroads in the limited stock of provisions carried on their backs.</p>
<p>Later on they relapsed into silence again, being pretty well worn out
and in need of refreshment. It was about this time that all of them
received a sudden rude shock when there came a savage snarl; and as
Elmer threw his light to the quarter whence came the significant sound
they discovered a crouching figure on the low limb of a tree under which
the winding trail to Log Cabin Bend apparently ran.</p>

</div>
<p>“Oh! what’s that?” gasped Perk.</p>
<p>“Stand perfectly still, everybody, or he may jump at us!” commanded the
leader.</p>
<p>“A whopping big cat, for a fact!” muttered Wee Willie, fumbling about
his waist, where he usually carried a homely so-called “hunting knife”
in a leather sheath, when on the hike.</p>
<p>“See his yellow and green eyes, will you!” muttered Amos. “He acts as if
as mad as hops because we came along. What ails him, do you think,
Elmer?”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t say,” replied the other, softly, “unless this one happens to
be a mother cat, with kits somewhere close by. They say such a varmint
is always doubly dangerous to a man in the woods, especially after
nightfall sets in.”</p>
<p>“What’ll we do about it—back out?” came in Perk’s quavering voice.</p>
<p>“I’d hate to do that, for fear of losing the trail,” said Elmer.</p>
<p>“But we’d get clawed up something fierce, wouldn’t we, if it came to a
fight with the savage critter? Just listen to the snarls, will you?” the
stout boy went on to say.</p>
<p>“Hold on!” suddenly remarked Amos; “leave it all to me, and I think I
can do the business. Just keep quiet for a minute or so, and then see
what’s going to happen.”</p>
<p>He was heard fumbling with some of the stuff he carried.</p>
<p>“You haven’t got a gun along now, have you, Amos?” asked Perk, with
possible visions of a wounded wildcat charging them, and committing more
or less scratching and biting before giving up the ghost.</p>
<p>“Something a heap better’n that,” panted Amos, himself excited for fear
the enraged beast might leap before he got his plans ready for carrying
out. “There, now I’ve got the thing loose; give me just time enough to
put a cartridge in place. Don’t be startled, fellows, when I pull the
trigger. It’s my camera flashlight I’m going to work on the old rascal.
Steady now!”</p>
<p>“Oh!” gasped Perk, comprehendingly.</p>
<div id='i019' style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-left:10.0%; width:80%;'>
  <img src='images/illus-019.jpg' alt='' style='width:100%' />
<p class='caption'>“A whopping big cat, for a fact!”</p>
</div>
<p>Even as he made this sound there came a dazzling flare that caused every
one to blink as if half blinded; indeed, a flash of lightning could not
have had a more startling effect.</p>
<p>“He jumped!” cried Perk, “but away from us! You certainly gave him the
scare of his life, Amos, with your bully camera outfit. Let’s be pushing
along, boys; somehow I don’t quite like this section of woods very
much.”</p>
<p>No one made any objection, and so the march was resumed. It might have
been noticed, however, that Perk made it a point not to lag behind. He
was continually imagining he saw crouching figures on many a low hanging
limb when Elmer’s light moved this way and that.</p>
<p>So they proceeded until finally Elmer announced that according to his
belief they were close to their destination.</p>
<p>“Thank you for saying that, Elmer,” remarked Perk, whole-heartedly, as
if he had never listened to more delightful words.</p>
<p>“Yes, here’s the river on our left,” added Wee Willie, encouragingly;
“and it looks to me as if we might be rounding the bend right now.”</p>
<p>“Just what we are,” affirmed Amos. “A bit back we were heading due east,
and now our course is almost north.”</p>
<p>“Well, there’s the old moon going peeking up on the right,” Perk
commented, cheerily. “I can’t remember a time I felt happier to glimpse
her smiling face. I’m tired of seeing things lying in wait for us. Ugh!”</p>
<p>Indeed, all of them felt somewhat the same way, so that when the moon
was discovered through the aisles of the forest her appearance was
greeted joyfully.</p>
<p>“Keep your eyes on the lookout for any signs of the old cabin,” Elmer
warned his three chums. “It would be a joke on us if we went past
without discovering it. But I’ve a notion this dim trail ought to lead
straight to the door.”</p>
<p>Accordingly four pairs of eager eyes kept on the alert every minute of
the time, and presently Wee Willie, who possessed remarkably keen
vision, made an eager announcement.</p>
<p>“There, over a little to the left—I’m sure it must be a shack under that
big tree!” he hastened to say.</p>
<p>“Something moved just then; didn’t you see it slip away?” Perk added in
a thrilling whisper.</p>
<p>“You’re still dreaming of cats by the wholesale, Perk!” chided the tall
chum, disdainfully.</p>
<p>“It was <i>something</i> that seemed to double over, and disappear back in
the shadows!” sturdily declared the stout boy; “mebbe only a dog,
though!”</p>
<p>“And what would any dog be doing away up here?” demanded Wee Willie.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve heard of wild dogs, that have run away from some farm, and
taken to living like their ancestors did by the chase,” Perk maintained.</p>
<p>“You only imagined you saw something, so forget it, please,” the other
assured him. “Now, here’s the cabin, let’s see what she looks like,
Elmer!”</p>
<p>By making good use of his little hand torch the leader was able to do as
requested. They all stared eagerly, and then Wee Willie gave vent to a
grunt of disappointment.</p>
<p>“Huh! a rickety old shack it is, believe me, boys!” he grumbled. “The
door hangs on one rusty hinge; and it looks to me as if the roof might
be as full of holes as a housewife’s sieve. Say, just imagine a bally
storm hitting us when cooped up in this rotten crib! We’d get soaked to
the bone, chances are. I think we’d be sensible to make a brush shanty.
Besides, now, I wouldn’t be surprised if the old cabin was haunted.”</p>
<p>“Oh! what makes you believe so?” demanded the thrilled Perk, his
thoughts possibly flying back to the flitting shadow he believed he had
detected at the time of their arrival on the scene.</p>
<p>“Never mind what he says, Perk,” soothed Elmer. “Here’s the cabin, and
if it is rather dilapidated, what’s to hinder our mending the roof
to-morrow, I’d like to know? Not much sign of rain to-night, as far as I
can see.”</p>
<p>“It’s all right, boys,” Amos now went on to say, cheerily; “let’s go
inside and get shut of these pesky packs. My shoulders feel raw from
carrying such a load for miles and miles. Mine must weigh twice as much
as when we started out.”</p>
<p>“Oh, easily four times that,” chanted Perk, eagerly. “There’s one good
thing, though, they’ll be heaps and heaps lighter going back home.”</p>
<p>“Sure thing, if your appetite is what it’s usually been, Perk,” chuckled
Wee Willie, as he pushed after Elmer, who had started to enter the
abandoned cabin.</p>
<p>“Drop the things here, and let’s get a fire started as soon as we can,”
suggested Elmer.</p>
<p>“Indoors or out?” demanded Wee Willie, as though by rights he took that
order on his shoulders; for it happened that he had long been known as a
veritable “crank” when it came to building fires, and could manage to
accomplish this result without the use of matches in half a dozen
different ways, some of them really wonderful.</p>
<p>“Outside for this time might be better, as the night is so warm, and we
don’t want to take chances of burning our shelter down about our ears,”
he was told.</p>
<p>That was enough for the tall chum, who tossing down his pack borrowed
Elmer’s hand torch so as to be able to gather some wood, and passing
out, proceeded to business. Perk pulled out a fragment of a candle,
purloined from home, which he lighted, and set on the gaping hearth.</p>
<p>“It isn’t much of a glim, but better than nothing at all,” he hastened
to say in apology. “I always carry some fag-ends of candles when I’m out
camping; you never know when you’ll need such things in a hurry. Whew!
so this is the shack that gave the place the name of Log Cabin Bend? You
c’n see the stars through the holes in the roof, for a fact.”</p>
<p>“We’ll mend that in the morning, Perk, so quit poking fun at our
palatial abode,” chided Amos. “And if you asked me, I’d say there’s no
apparent reason why we shouldn’t make ourselves mighty comfy here, given
a little time, and some elbow grease.”</p>
<p>Already had the fire-maker managed to start his blaze, though likely
enough he did not scorn to make use of a plain every-day match on this
special occasion, knowing it was hardly the time for any “fiddling” with
tedious methods of inducing a spark, coaxed into being by means of flint
and steel, or some other aboriginal method of procedure.</p>
<p>As the flames leaped up, seizing on the dry wood Wee Willie had arranged
so cleverly, the glow attracted the others, who came trooping out,
showing by their actions how pleased they were to be finally free from
their burdens.</p>
<p>“The first campfire for this outing!” remarked Perk, his round face
aglow, while his eyes sparkled with satisfaction. “And how long will it
be before your fire is fit for cooking over, Wee Willie?”</p>
<p>The other gave him a queer look, and seemed on the point of saying
something sharp, but restrained himself.</p>
<p>“Right soon, so you might as well be getting the ham and eggs and coffee
out of the packs, fellows. Say, I’m as hungry as a homeless dog; so be
sure you cook double rations, Perk.”</p>
<p>“Leave that to me,” chuckled the other, ambling back inside the cabin in
order to round up the necessary cooking implements and then root out the
ingredients of the first meal in camp.</p>
<p>Elmer walked about meanwhile as though investigating the surroundings,
so as to figure on what they would find it necessary to do in order to
make the old shack habitable. Several times Wee Willie glanced toward
the other as though he might have something on his mind. Finally he
arose from his knees and joined Elmer.</p>
<p>“Noticed you sniffing like you suspected there might be a skunk in the
offing?” he finally remarked. “Fact is, I thought myself there was a
queer kind of odor around here, inside the cabin in particular.”</p>
<p>“That’s the idea I had,” assented Elmer, softly, “but this isn’t
anything in the line of a polecat; if you asked me I’d say it was some
sort of villainous tobacco, such as a tramp might pick up in a wayside
field, and smoke in his pipe as he lay around after his supper!”</p>
<p>“By George, fellows! there goes somebody now! I’m <i>sure</i> I saw him this
time!” said Perk excitedly, coming through the door and pointing through
a dusky lane of trees. “Now tell me again that I am only imagining
things!”</p>

</h2>
</div>
<p>After all Elmer’s effort to keep his voice down when talking to the tall
chum, Perk had heard what was said. He happened to be coming out of the
door just at that moment, as luck would have it, and so caught the full
significance of the remark. But try as they might, no one else saw the
lurking figure he again pointed out.</p>
<p>“I guess you score, Perk,” admitted the one addressed, for whatever Wee
Willie had in the way of faults, and he was not by any means perfect, he
never failed to make amends when an occasion arose for it.</p>
<p>“What’s all the talk about, I want to know?” demanded Amos, showing up
just then, and with all a natural boy’s curiosity aroused.</p>
<p>“Why, Elmer was just saying, and I agreed with him,” explained the tall
pal, “that there was an odor of stale tobacco smoke hanging around this
old cabin. He thinks it may have been some wandering tramp who put up
here for the night.”</p>
<p>“But,” interposed Perk, “why should he skip out so quick when he heard
us coming along the trail, or else caught the glimmer of Elmer’s torch?
You’d think the poor chap’d feel mighty lonely, away off the beaten
track of his kind, and be glad of our company.”</p>
<p>“Which remark shows how little you know of the hobo tribe in general,”
chuckled the angular boy. “Most of the Weary Willies are born thieves,
and only want a chance to steal to let themselves out.”</p>
<p>“Many are, anyhow,” admitted the more conservative Elmer, “and for all
we know, this fellow has done something that makes him afraid of
officers of the Law.”</p>
<p>“But he may come back again?” hazarded Perk, dubiously, a cloud
beginning to gather upon his forehead, as though some of his
expectations of a carefree holiday had received a sudden and unexpected
backset.</p>
<p>“That’s true enough for you, Perk,” agreed the grinning Wee Willie; “but
take my word for it, if he does it’ll not be to make our acquaintance.”</p>
<p>“What then?” asked the other, quickly, looking worried still.</p>
<p>“Oh! I reckon tramps have <i>fero</i>cious appetites, and get good and
hungry,” continued the tall chum; “and if he hangs around for a bit
he’ll smell our jolly supper cooking, which ought to make him well-nigh
frantic.”</p>
<p>“Then you mean he may sneak back here during the night, with the idea of
stealing some of our grub; is that it?” questioned Perk, his anxiety
taking a new turn.</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t surprise me much if he did,” coolly observed Wee Willie.</p>
<p>“But you’re only guessing it was a tramp,” said Amos just then.</p>
<p>“Why, yes, that’s a fact,” admitted Elmer. “To be sure the man might be
something entirely different from a hobo.”</p>
<p>“As what, Elmer?” asked Perk.</p>
<p>“Oh! there are a number of answers to your question, Perk,” the leader
informed him. “For instance, this chap might be some fugitive from
justice who had broken jail, and was in hiding.”</p>
<p>“Yes, or even a lunatic at large,” continued Wee Willie, perhaps amused
to see how eagerly the other was swallowing all these suggestions; “for
we happen to know such a thing did happen once, years back; for the
State Asylum for the Insane is located not much more’n twenty miles
northeast of our home town of Chester.”</p>
<p>“Then there might be another explanation for his being here,” spoke up
Amos. “I chanced to be talking with the head game warden only a week
back, and he told me he had never known the game poachers so daring as
this season. They have shot deer, snared partridge and rabbits out of
season, and laid illegal set-lines for black bass in some of the best
lakes of the county.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Elmer added, thoughtfully, “it might be one of those bold game
hogs who didn’t want to be seen up here, where he really had no right to
be. But why bother our heads so about the fellow? He’s skipped out, and
the chances are we’ll never glimpse hide nor hair of him again. Perk was
the only one who got a peep at the slippery rascal.”</p>
<p>Accordingly the subject was dropped, for the time being at any rate; but
Perk looked unusually grave as he proceeded to get supper, as though
creeping, mysterious men kept looming up before his mental vision.</p>
<p>Indeed, doubtless the little mystery connected with the strange actions
of the unknown would give each one of the boys cause for more or less
reflection, and vague speculation.</p>
<p>The supper was voted a great success. Perk prided himself on his ability
as a cook; and since the others usually commended his efforts to the
skies he almost always insisted on doing the lion’s share of this work;
to which of course no one objected in the least.</p>
<p>The sliced ham was browned to a nicety, the eggs, carefully packed so as
not to be broken in transit, were “turned” or not, to suit the
individual taste of each fellow; the coffee seemed like ambrosia, so
fragrant and cheering did it appear; while the home-made bread, with
genuine butter for a spread, added much to the enjoyment of their first
meal in camp.</p>
<p>These four lads of Chester had been accustomed to similar outings during
the summer holidays, and thus banded together called themselves the
“Camp Fire Boys,” a name that seemed to possess a certain charm in their
eyes as it was bound always to recall the jolly times they had when
camping out in company.</p>
<p>Elmer Kitching had always possessed an ardent love for everything
connected with the Great Outdoors. He came by this nature honestly, for
his father in his day had been a well-known naturalist, whom such famous
men as Teddy Roosevelt himself, John Burroughs, and others along the
same line had been glad to consult when preparing articles for
publication, in order to verify their own observations concerning
animated nature.</p>
<p>His mother, now a widow, was comfortably well off, and Elmer had a young
sister at home by the name of Rebecca.</p>
<p>Amos Codling lived with his mother and three younger children. They had
not mingled very much with other folks since coming to Chester; the
widow returned no calls, and seemed content to look after her family.
Some were inclined to think this rather strange; but by degrees it
became the conviction of her neighbors that she must have seen great
trouble, and shrank from contact with the rough world. Her children were
always well dressed, and bright in school; but even the town gossips
could find out next to nothing about the previous history of the Codling
family, save that they came from a big city.</p>
<p>Wee Willie Winkleman was the son of the owner of the finest motion
picture theater in Chester. As has been stated before, his prevailing
passion was the ambition to discover new and novel methods of making
fires without the use of matches. That had become such a “fad” with the
tall chum that he even dreamed about it, and had been known to get up in
the middle of the night to try out some queer scheme which had visited
him in his sleep.</p>
<p>Perk, the beloved pal, was famous for his amiable disposition. Few
fellows had ever seen him show a trace of anger. Indeed, his beaming
smile could, the boys claimed, melt the flinty heart of almost any
farmer around town; though this rule had its exceptions. Perk was
frequently in trouble; likewise rosy-cheeked, and guileless, he was also
addicted to straying from beaten paths in the woods, and getting lost;
but never from the truth, since his word was as good as most fellows’
bond. His father was a railroad engineer, and likewise rather ponderous
of build.</p>
<p>As the evening crept along, Wee Willie every once in a while might have
been noticed glancing sharply in the direction of Amos. It struck him
that the other was acting unusually nervous, for he would get up and
walk around for a minute or two, and then again throw himself down.</p>
<p>“Something must be bothering Amos, that’s dead sure,” the tall chum told
himself; and at the same time determined to speak of the fact to Elmer
if a chance offered.</p>
<p>He had never been quite as close to Amos as Elmer, though for that
matter it was extremely doubtful if even the latter had been taken into
the confidence of the Codling boy, who knew how to keep a “close mouth,”
as Wee Willie called it.</p>
<p>“Still, it may be he’s eaten too much supper, and his digestion is
troubling him,” was the final conclusion Wee Willie reached.</p>
<p>They sat around for some time, talking after their habit. It was hard to
realize that they were all of sixteen miles from home, and surrounded by
the primeval forest, up there in the Tall Timber, as that belt of the
big wilderness was known.</p>
<p>“This just suits me to a dot,” Wee Willie said for the fourth time as he
poked at the fire, and sighed with complete happiness. “Guess I was just
born to be a tramp, and make fires across the whole Continent, I love to
hear the crackle of the flames so much.”</p>
<p>“I’m really concerned about you sometimes, Wee Willie,” said Elmer,
pretending to look serious, though the sparkle in his gray eyes belied
his words and manner. “If this craze for fires keeps up you’ll be
tempted to run with the machine; and then when there’s a slacking up of
business set a few haystacks ablaze just to keep your hand in.”</p>
<p>“Not much I will,” retorted the other. “My fad is in inventing new and
novel ways for <i>creating</i> fires. I consider a good blaze man’s best
friend, when held in hand; let it break away, and I own up it may become
his worst enemy. All good things can be abused, remember, and fire isn’t
an exception to the general rule.”</p>
<p>“About time we looked after our beds, isn’t it?” asked Perk,
accompanying his words with a tremendous yawn.</p>
<p>“Oh! that isn’t going to take much time,” scoffed Wee Willie, “seeing
how we all share alike. It’s a hard bed for to-night, on the floor of
the cabin. To-morrow we’ll hunt for hemlock browse, and ease things up.
I’m the one who will suffer most, because my bones stick out so, without
pads, like Perk here carries around with him.”</p>
<p>Amidst considerable merriment they soon laid out their double camping
blankets, of a gray or dun color as most suitable for the purpose, and
“less liable to show dirt spots,” as Perk always slyly claimed.</p>
<p>“It’s good night boys for me,” that individual was saying, as he
stripped off his coat, kicked his shoes into a corner and commenced to
crawl under his warm woolen cover. “Say, this feels just great; you
fellows’d better make up your minds to follow my example, and turn in.”</p>
<p>He was sound asleep in less than ten minutes, when the others were ready
to seek cover. Wee Willie stared down at his round moonlike face, and
nodded his head as he turned to Elmer and Amos to say softly:</p>
<p>“Looks like a sweet cherub lying there, with such a happy smile on his
mug. No use talking, Perk is the best-natured chap in seven counties.
I’ve been mean enough more’n a few times to try my level best to make
him mad, but had to give it up; he just looked at me, and kept on
smiling until I had to turn and walk away bested; bless his big heart!”</p>
<p>Elmer nodded in approval of these words of appreciation, and Amos too
showed that he echoed the sentiments expressed by the tall chum.</p>
<p>“I’ve known a lot of fellows,” he went on to say, “but never his like.
If all boys were built like good old Perk there’d be a heap less trouble
in this world. I know I’d have been saved more or less suffering
myself.”</p>
<p>Wee Willie looked quickly at the speaker, as though he half expected
Amos to take them into his confidence; but instead the other simply bent
down and started to push his extremities under his blanket.</p>
<p>The fire still burned without, and although the door was closed, Perk
having succeeded in fastening it with a piece of stout rope, through
innumerable apertures the flickering glow stole, making queer pictures
on the wall beyond, that came and went like phantom drawings.</p>
<p>Elmer lay there and watched them for some time, his thoughts far afield,
possibly in his Chester home with the dear ones there. Gradually his
eyes closed and he lost track of even these precious ties in restful
slumber.</p>
<p>Time passed by, several hours elapsing, when Elmer suddenly sat half-way
up. Surely he had heard the yapping of a dog somewhere near by. This not
only interested him but aroused an intense curiosity. Then he noticed
that both Wee Willie and Amos also gave signs of being awake.</p>
<p>Now voices could be heard. They were heavy tones that came to Elmer’s
ears, as of mature men. Crunching footsteps followed, then a loud
pounding.</p>
<p>“Open up here!” boomed a voice, followed by further sonorous knocks.</p>
<div class='chapter'>

</h2>
</div>
<p>“All right, dad; I’m up!”</p>
<p>That was Perk, who, aroused so suddenly by the racket doubtless imagined
himself at home in his own bed, with his father rapping on the wall when
the son indulged in his favorite habit of oversleeping mornings.</p>
<p>Elmer, Amos and Wee Willie were already on deck, having jumped to their
feet in a hurry. The gruff voice seemed to be one invested with some
degree of authority; it struck them all “in a heap,” as the tall chum
afterwards described the sudden awakening.</p>
<p>Again came that loud thumping on the quivering door.</p>
<p>“Hurry up and open, do you hear?” rasped the voice, now with a touch of
anger in the tones. “Don’t think you can escape, because we’ve got you
cornered like a rat. Better be sensible, and go back with us!”</p>
<p>“Oh! my stars! who is it, and what <i>does</i> he mean?” gasped Perk,
realizing at last that things were quite different from what he had at
first imagined.</p>
<p>Perk was really responsible for the fastened door. He had in his
timidity pictured the frowsy tramp creeping back when they were all fast
asleep, and perhaps almost cleaning out their limited supply of
provisions, thus bringing the glorious camping trip to an untimely end;
since four healthy boys could not be expected to stay up in the woods
without sufficient “grub” to keep the wolf from the door.</p>
<p>So he had managed to make a shift with a piece of clothes-line (which
was likely to be searched for in vain at home when next washday came
along), securing the door so that it could not be opened from without
unless by a display of extreme violence.</p>
<p>Elmer was by now across the cabin. He touched the planks of which the
door was composed, to find them still quivering under the impact of the
unknown party’s knuckles.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute, and we’ll open up; the door is fastened, don’t you
understand? Hold your horses, Mister; I’m undoing it right now!” he
called out.</p>
<p>Immediately he caught the sound of voices again just beyond. Evidently
the men, whoever they might turn out to be, seemed astonished at
something, perhaps disappointed in the bargain. Once more there also
came to the ears of the boys the eager whining of a dog. Elmer imagined
that this animal might have been partly responsible for the visit of
these midnight prowlers.</p>
<p>Perk gave a low cry as the door suddenly swung back under Elmer’s push.
The moon was shining brightly, and standing there in its mellow glow
were two stalwart figures and a hound. The first thing Perk noticed was
the fact that both men were garbed in some sort of uniform, with caps
that bordered on the military.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the two men were bending forward and looking at the youthful
group that filled the doorway of the cabin. One of them gave a grunt,
and followed this with a scornful laugh that grated on the nerves like a
file.</p>
<p>“There you are, Collins, with all your being so sure we’d find the
tricky chap located here, just because his trail headed this way. Sold
again, Elihu, and off the scent once more! Now perhaps you’ll pay some
attention to <i>my</i> plan of campaign, since yours has petered out so
flat.”</p>
<p>The other man continued to stare at Elmer and his mates.</p>
<p>“Who are you chaps anyway, and what’re you doing here?” he demanded.</p>
<p>“Oh! that’s easily explained,” said the Kitching boy cheerily. “We all
belong in Chester, you see, and make up the Camp Fire Boys’ Club. Just
now we are on one of our regular trips to the woods for sport, and to
wind up the summer vacation. My name is Elmer Kitching, this is Amos
Codling; the tall chum is a son of Caleb Winkleman who owns the classy
motion picture theater in our town; and the last boy is Perk—his dad is
an engineer on the B. &amp; S. Railroad. Might I ask who you are, and what
you expected to find here in this shack at Old Cabin Bend of the
Beaverkill?”</p>
<p>“That’s a civil question, youngster, and since you’ve been so obliging,
I don’t mind answering it. Me and my mate Andrews here are guards over
at the big State Asylum for the Insane. A few days ago one of the
inmates managed to escape, and we’ve been searching the whole
countryside for him ever since. Our hound here found and lost his trail
again and again in the queerest way ever. The last time he ran it out
the fugitive was heading this way. Somehow I got a notion he must know
about this old cabin here, and was making for it. You see I originally
came from Crawford Notch, and knew all about the deserted cabin up here.
So I influenced my pal to drop around.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” broke in the man who had been called Andrews, “and when we caught
the glimmer of a dying fire through the trees, Collins here was dead
sure we’d treed our coon at last. But the game is all off again, it
seems; and we can start in looking where we left off; warning the
farmers as we go to keep their eyes peeled for a clever chap who’ll
hoodwink them with his blarney, if he gets half a chance.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for telling us,” said Elmer; “and in return let me say that
when we struck this cabin some time after moonrise to-night, there was
an odor of stale tobacco smoke hanging around inside. One of my chums
here also declared he glimpsed some sort of figure bending over like an
animal, and getting out of sight in a hurry!”</p>
<p>At hearing this the men both uttered exclamations that told of renewed
interest. “That sounds interesting,” said Collins, warmly. “It might be
we can pick up a fresh trail around these diggings. About where was it
he was seen?”</p>
<p>“Perk, step up here,” said Elmer; “can you point out the spot for the
gentlemen?”</p>
<p>“Sure thing, Elmer. There, over to the left yonder, see the tree that
seems to bend over toward the southeast—it was right under that same I
sighted a moving figure; but it flashed out of sight before I could rub
my eyes twice to make sure.”</p>
<p>“That’s aplenty, Perk, and thank you,” said Collins, who seemed a pretty
decent sort of a chap after all, though he must have been terribly
disappointed when his theory turned to bitter fruit; his comrade’s jeers
too had not added to his enjoyment of the situation.</p>
<p>“Let’s try the dog around that place,” immediately suggested the other
man, plainly full of action. “If it’s our bird, Jock’ll soon give
tongue, and lead us off right smart.”</p>
<p>“Our only play, I reckon,” agreed Collins. “So good night, boys; hope
you have a bully time of it in camp; used to do that sort of thing
myself years back, and know what it means. We’ll soon be clearing out of
this region, hit or miss, so you won’t be pestered with our hound
barking for long.”</p>
<p>Elmer and the others saw them hurry away with mingled emotions. Despite
the fact that the night air seemed pretty chilly, and their garments
exceedingly thin, they continued to huddle in the open doorway,
listening and watching.</p>
<p>Even Perk refused to go back again to his snug blanket so long as the
other three remained there; and once Elmer heard him saying softly, as
though to himself:</p>
<p>“Poor thing, just to think of him out of his mind, and wandering at
large in these big woods, hungry, and without even a blanket to hug
nights. I almost wish he’d crept in, and cribbed that last loaf of bread
we fetched along.”</p>
<p>That was Perk all over, full of feeling for any one apt to be suffering;
and it was this spirit of wanting to be of service that endeared him to
the hearts of all his boy friends in Chester.</p>
<p>“There’s the hound picking up!” snapped Amos, suddenly.</p>
<p>“But you want to notice there isn’t a note of eagerness in his baying,”
added Elmer, quickly. “If he’s found any sort of scent at all, it isn’t
what he’s been searching for. You can even detect a sort of disappointed
sound about his mournful notes.”</p>
<p>“That’s what!” echoed Wee Willie. “Either the lunatic has been too smart
for the trackers, or else it wasn’t him after all, and the dog knows
it.”</p>
<p>Elmer shut the door again, though only with an effort, owing to its
really dilapidated condition. And Perk, as if in duty bound, proceeded
again to adjust his rope guard. It had served them one good turn
already, he figured; because had those two guards burst suddenly in upon
them, their consternation must have been many times aggravated.</p>
<p>“A nice state of affairs, I must say!” Wee Willie was grumbling. “We
came all the way up here to camp in solitude and peace, and now see what
we’re up against! Gee whiz! can you beat it?”</p>
<p>“No, but mebbe we’d better beat it for home,” Perk faintly suggested, as
if even the thought gave him fresh pain.</p>
<p>“Here, none of that, Perk,” sternly rebuked Elmer. “We’re not the kind
to be frightened off by such a silly little thing as that. We’ll stick
it out, no matter what comes along!”</p>
<p>“Hear! hear!” came from Wee Willie; while Amos too added his voice to
the chorus, and even Perk hastened to say:</p>
<p>“Oh! I didn’t really mean it, I assure you, boys, and you can believe
me. I’ll hang on as long as the next one, no matter if the whole asylum
breaks loose.”</p>

</h2>
</div>
<p>It was some time before the boys could settle down again to sleep. Perk
often believed he could catch a distant yap from the ranging hound, and
it never failed to give him a thrill. The beast had seemed both big, and
inclined to be savage; and Perk could not help shuddering to think of
his getting loose from his leash and coming on the cringing lunatic
somewhere in the lonely timber.</p>
<p>But finally even the anxious Perk succumbed, and when he again opened
his eyes it was to find that daylight had come, with Elmer outside
starting up the fire, and some one else rattling the tin pans, as if
getting ready for a jolly breakfast.</p>
<p>As that was encroaching on his private preserves, Perk hastened to bob
up and assure the others he would soon be on deck, prepared to make a
mess of his savory “flapjacks,” as he had solemnly promised to do the
very first morning in camp.</p>
<p>Soon every one was busily engaged, for there was bound to be “heaps” of
work laid out for that wonderful day. Amos was examining the dilapidated
roof of the cabin and settling just how they should go about rendering
it waterproof; Wee Willie beat some batter in a tin vessel, under the
eye of the self-constituted master of ceremonies (for Perk had actually
donned a snow-white peakless cap, fashioned after a regular <i>chef’s</i>
headgear, doubtless meaning to have no dispute regarding his recognized
rights to the exalted title); while Elmer had taken to looking around
outside, especially over in the quarter of the leaning birch tree.</p>
<p>He came over to the fire a little later, and Wee Willie at once detected
indications in his face that made him suspicious.</p>
<p>“You’ve discovered something new, Elmer, now don’t deny it!” he
immediately asserted.</p>
<p>“What is it?” hastily demanded Perk.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Elmer, quietly, “it’s just this; whoever that man may be,
he came back again during the night!”</p>
<p>This information caused all of the others to show fresh interest. Perk
was just in the act of tossing aloft his first flapjack, and in his
nervousness he actually missed connections, so that the delectable
morsel ignominiously fell into the ashes, and was thus lost.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t up to the mark, anyhow,” the nervous cook hastened to say in
apology; “first off the pan shouldn’t be eaten, I always claim. But you
<i>did</i> give me a jolt, Elmer, when you said that.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?” questioned Wee Willie; “run across the sign, did
you?”</p>
<p>“He walked completely around the cabin twice,” stated the other. “From
the indications I’d say he must have been a heap surprised to discover
that it had occupants; for I take it, he could hear some of us breathing
pretty hard.”</p>
<p>“Huh! needn’t all look right at <i>me</i>,” Wee Willie hastened to snap, as
he colored up amidst his freckles. “I made out to lie on my side the
whole live-long night, I’d take my affidavy on that. I admit that once
in a while I do snore; but that’s when I roll over on my back, and have
been gorging at supper on such things as mince pie and other heavy
stuff. Go on, Elmer!”</p>
<p>“I know what you are thinking,” Elmer continued; “how could I decide
that the man didn’t make those marks before we came? I’ll tell you what
proof I have right now. In the first place there isn’t much dew in the
tracks, which I reckon would indicate that the footprints were made
shortly before dawn. Am I right there, Wee Willie? You’re well up in
woodcraft, and ought to be able to say.”</p>
<p>“Sounds good to me,” grunted the other, wagging his head violently in
the affirmative, while a pleased expression on his thin face told how
much he felt complimented by having Elmer defer in this fashion to his
judgment.</p>
<p>“Well, I had another good proof,” Elmer went on to say, with one of his
reassuring smiles. “Where the tracks crossed the marks left by Collins
and his pal they overlapped; that is, this footprint broke into the ones
made by the two guards from the asylum!”</p>
<p>“Splendid work, Elmer!” cried Perk, this time succeeding brilliantly in
tossing up his second flapjack, which alighted successfully in the pan,
with the browned side up. “Guess he did come prowling around then, and
like as not tried the door more’n once. Say, I’m real glad I fastened it
as well as I did.”</p>
<p>“What do you suppose he wanted?” queried Amos, looking even more serious
than was his habit.</p>
<p>“Not being a mind reader,” Elmer told him, “I couldn’t say; but to make
a stab at it I’d guess he hoped we’d gone along, and he could have his
old cabin to himself again.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’ll always be a big mystery who and what this chap can be,” Wee
Willie concluded. “I only hope now he knows we’re stopping here he’ll
take the hint, and keep off the grass. It’ll go rough with any hobo <i>we</i>
catch bothering our traps, let me tell you. Here, put that one on this
warm plate I’ve got on this flat stone alongside the fire, Perk. It
makes a beginning, and we can soon be starting in to feed.”</p>
<p>“Somebody open that bottle of maple syrup,” observed the bustling cook a
little later on, as another “cart-wheel” cake went turning over in the
air, to be caught dexterously again in the pan. “And when I get a third
one ready you’d better start in eating while they’re fresh and hot. The
coffee’s done; and of course I don’t mean to commence until somebody can
spell me here.”</p>
<p>In good time they were doing full justice to Perk’s famous flapjacks;
which each and every camper solemnly declared when passing up his
pie-tin for more were really unequaled by anything served at the
breakfast table at home.</p>
<p>Of course Wee Willie presently insisted on taking Perk’s place, so that
the <i>chef</i> might take the edge off his own appetite; until finally all
of them declared they could not swallow another bite, and with three
cakes left over.</p>
<p>“For munching on between meals, if any one wants a snack,” Perk
explained, as he put them aside. “Nothing to be wasted in this camp—that
is, except perhaps the first tryout in a batch.”</p>
<p>Then they commenced to do things, each one having jotted down certain
tasks that should be attended to without delay.</p>
<p>Elmer and Wee Willie took upon their shoulders the mending of the cabin
roof; patching up sundry apertures between the logs of the walls, where
the dried mud had long since fallen away through the action of time and
weather combined; and also renewing the broken hinge on the cumbersome
door.</p>
<p>Perk insisted on cleaning up the breakfast things; somehow he loved to
serve in the capacity of cook, and his mates seemed perfectly willing to
have it so, strange to say.</p>
<p>As for Amos, already he had his precious camera out, and announced his
intention of searching the immediate neighborhood, in hopes of securing
some unusual picture.</p>
<p>“I’d like above all things to find a late partridge on her nest,” he was
explaining ere he sauntered forth. “I’ve always wanted to get a picture
of the bird on her eggs, or strutting around with her chicks; but I’m
afraid it’s a heap too late in the season for such a thing to happen.”</p>
<p>“As a rule the early brood is pretty well grown by now,” commented
Elmer; “still, I remember finding a nest with eggs in it as late as
this, and you might be just lucky enough. Wish you success, Amos; and if
I can help you in any way let me know.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps you may when I get a chance to set a camera trap at night, so
some cunning ’coon, or frisky mink, will take his own picture. That’s my
ambition, you know, Elmer, though I’m not building my hopes too high,
not wanting to be disappointed.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t stray too far away, if I were you, Amos,” hinted Wee Willie.</p>
<p>“Oh! I’m a pretty fair woodsman,” insisted the other, “and I reckon now
the chances of my getting lost are small. But I’ll just wander around
the Bend here, and sort of get my bearings, as well as keep one eye out
for anything that appeals to me.”</p>
<p>“And keep the other on the watch for signs of that tramp, or lunatic,
Amos,” Perk insisted on warning him solicitously.</p>
<p>So Amos walked away, carrying his camera along with him. Elmer looked
after him with an expression akin to concern on his young face, which
shrewd Wee Willie was quick to notice.</p>
<p>“Something seems to be bothering him, don’t you think, Elmer?” the
latter asked in a low tone so that Perk might not hear what he said.</p>
<p>“Y-es, I’ve thought so myself lately,” admitted Elmer, slowly; “though
you remember, Amos has always been a sobersides of a chap ever since we
came to know him. There’s a sort of family trouble weighing down on him,
I reckon; something that is no one else’s business. I’d like to comfort
him if only I knew how to go about it; but I don’t want to kick in where
outsiders have no right. But let’s change the subject, Wee Willie; I
dislike talking about any of my chums.”</p>
<p>They worked industriously for an hour and more, and under their clever
tactics the roof began to show decided signs of improvement. Indeed,
already one-half of its surface had been rendered impervious to water,
after the boys had succeeded in thatching it with bark stripped from
certain trees, and overlapping like the shingles on an ordinary house.</p>
<p>“By the time we get through we needn’t be afraid of the heaviest kind of
a rainfall,” said Elmer, confidently; “unless it’s accompanied by a
fierce wind, such as might strip all this off in a jiffy.”</p>
<p>“Where’s Perk gone?” asked Wee Willie; “I thought I heard him saying
something just then, but it sounded as if he was off somewhere.”</p>
<p>“I saw him prowling around in the brush yonder ten minutes ago,” Elmer
informed him. “Like as not he’s just bent on seeing if there’s a good
spot for fishing at the Bend here; because, you know Perk dearly loves
to pull in the frisky black bass, or the striped perch, as well as eat
the same.”</p>
<p>“Listen! wasn’t that him speaking again?” hissed Wee Willie, stopping
his task of fastening a strip of pliable bark with small round tins,
through each of which a nail could be driven, such as are used to secure
tarred paper to the roofs of chicken coops and other small outbuildings.</p>
<p>“No, you don’t, not this time, you nasty thing!” Perk was heard saying
half in disgust, and with a tinge of consternation in his tones. “Curl
up again, and shake your old locust rattle as much as you please, who
cares?”</p>
<p>“Perk!” shouted Elmer excitedly, recognizing a certain dreadful sound
that now floated to his ears, “back away! Don’t fool with a rattlesnake,
you silly! Back water, and in a hurry!”</p>
<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chVI' title='VI: The Events of a Day'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER VI</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>THE EVENTS OF A DAY</span>
</h2>
</div>
<p>Both boys leaped to the ground without waiting to agree on any
particular program. They had recognized the peculiar buzz of an angry
rattlesnake, so like the shrill sound made by a locust on a hot August
day, and once heard never afterwards forgotten.</p>
<p>The thought of their chum taking any chances with such a dangerous viper
thrilled them, and also gave them a chill. Elmer snatched up the first
stick he could see, in which he was speedily imitated by the other. Then
they started on the run, heading directly for the spot whence that
furious whirring sound sprang.</p>
<p>As they went thus they heard another sort of disturbance, as though some
object might be swishing through the bushes, or else beating the ground.
Then again came the voice of Perk, uttering low warwhoops, as though
furiously engaged, while the rattle gradually became uncertain, and
finally ceased to sound.</p>
<p>“Take that with my compliments, and here’s another of the same sort!
Huh! lunge at a fellow who didn’t mean to bother you at all, will you?
Guess I’ve done for <i>your</i> hash all right, thanks to this bully pole.
Hello! fellows, just come up in time to see me clip him the last
stunner. He’s settled, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Elmer breathed easier when he saw that bulky Perk had snatched up a
convenient pole, and with this had proceeded to break the back-bone of
the angry snake. It was even then squirming on the ground, and judging
from its length must be an old campaigner, being fully three feet, which
could be considered fair proportions for a Northern specimen.</p>
<p>“He didn’t get to you, I hope, Perk?” was the first question Elmer
asked, at which the other grinned, and shook his head vigorously in the
negative.</p>
<p>“Glad to say he didn’t, Elmer; but shucks! if he could only have flung
himself his full length, instead of only half, I believe he’d have
struck me. But I did for him, let me tell you, that’s right. Six
rattles, and a prime button to wind up with, to show for my encounter!
Whew!”</p>
<p>“But didn’t you hear his warning rattle?” demanded Wee Willie; “I never
knew a case where one of his stripe didn’t shake his can like thunder
before you almost stepped on him. They’re the only honorable snake there
is.”</p>
<p>Perk colored up, and then candidly admitted his shortcoming.</p>
<p>“Why, er, you see, I just must have thought it was only a locust buzzing
away like all get-out,” he confessed, in some confusion. “Then all at
once he launched himself out at me, to fall short; but like a flash he
was coiled again, and starting in to make that queer buzzing sound once
more. Oh! yes, I did get a shock, and felt as cold as ice for a few
seconds; then my dander seemed to rise, and I just looked around for a
pole, which luckily enough happened to be handy. It knocked him silly,
you can see.”</p>
<p>“We’ll take no chances with such a slick neighbor,” said Wee Willie, who
happened to be carrying the camp hatchet in his left hand; with which he
now proceeded to decapitate the squirming snake. “There, be careful not
to step on his head, Perk; I’ve heard of a case where a man died by
doing that, the sharp fangs running into his foot through his soft
moccasin.”</p>
<p>Perk was contented to obtain possession of the rattle as a memento of
his late exciting encounter. He showed some concern over the matter.</p>
<p>“I certainly hope there isn’t a nest of these chaps hanging around Log
Cabin Bend,” he remarked, solicitously. “What with watching for snakes,
and escaped lunatics, I can see where we’re bound to be on the alert
every minute of our stay up here.”</p>
<p>“So far as that goes, it always pays to keep your eyes open when afoot
in the Tall Timber,” Elmer warned him. “You never know what you may run
up against any minute; and preparedness is the right bower of every
woodsman worthy of the name. Already we’ve run across three instances of
this—first there was that crouching cat Amos frightened off with his
flashlight; then came the mysterious party who slipped away from the
cabin at our approach; and now this venomous snake that was lying coiled
in your path, and on which you might have trod unawares only for his
generous warning.”</p>
<p>“This ought to be a good lesson to me, Elmer,” humbly admitted the
contrite Perk. “I realize that I’m a whole lot short on woods lore, and
all those things some of my fine pards know so much about; but I mean to
soak in a wheen of the same while we’re up here in camp. Yes, every time
I shake this rattle it’ll remind me how wofully lacking I am in
scoutcraft, and everything connected with life in the woods.”</p>
<p>“Everything perhaps except the splendid art of cookery, Perk,” remarked
the cunning Wee Willie, adroitly feeding the ambition of the other to
shine as an artist along such lines; “there you’ve got the bunch of us
left at the post.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” remarked the other, with a puff of unconscious pride, while his
eyes fairly sparkled with pleasure at receiving such a compliment, “I
suppose a fellow can’t be up head in everything; where one excels,
another fails to hit the mark. And perhaps it’s just as well that I have
a knack for the noble culinary art.”</p>
<p>Perk went back to camp with the others, as though for the time being his
desire to look around had received a decided setback.</p>
<p>“I’ll come out and put the ugly thing underground later on,” he said;
“for such trash ought to be buried deep, so as to keep the air around
the camp sweet and pure. I burned some insect powder inside the cabin,
you may have noticed, just to get rid of that stale odor we took to come
from rank tobacco. It’s a disinfectant in the bargain.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, Perk,” assented Wee Willie, promptly; “anyway, it almost
disinfected me when I poked my head indoors a while back, to see if
there might be any cavity we’d overlooked. Made the tears come, too, so
that Elmer he asked me, when I got back on the roof, if I’d had any bad
news from home. But then I left the door wide open, so it’ll gradually
pass away, let’s hope.”</p>
<p>The two menders of leaky roofs were soon at their old job, while Perk
readily found something else to occupy his time and attention. He had
pounded nails galore in the wall near the cavity which was used as a
fireplace, and on these he hung such cooking utensils as they had
fetched along with them, consisting of a large sized coffeepot; a
generous frying pan; some kettles in which grits or rice or oatmeal
might be cooked; likewise a little teapot, for Perk was a regular old
maid when it came to the question of drinking a decoction of the
fragrant herb at lunch or supper, preferring it to Java at any time.</p>
<p>Along about half-past-ten by Elmer’s little nickel watch who should come
in but Amos, with a look of eager expectation on his face.</p>
<p>“Guess you struck oil somewhere, didn’t you, brother?” asked Wee Willie,
as if able rightly to interpret this expression of anticipated triumph.</p>
<p>“Would you believe it,” crowed Amos, “I had the great good luck to scare
a bird out of the thicket where the berries are growing that partridges
like to feed on early in the Fall; and on investigating there was a
nest, with some eggs in it, and warm at that? Of course it’s a silly
bird that hopes to fetch up a flock of nestlings hatched out so near
frost time, but it was pie to me!”</p>
<p>“What did you do?” demanded Perk, looking deeply interested.</p>
<p>“Well, I fixed my camera so it focussed on the nest, with the proper
effect of light,” explained Amos. “Then I crept away to some little
distance, keeping in tabs with it all, so I’d know when to pull the
string that would free the trigger of the camera, and expose the plate
in a jiffy.”</p>
<p>“And did it work; was the old bird so little alarmed that she’d come
back to her nest before the eggs got chilled?” continued Perk.</p>
<p>“Just what she did,” assented the eager photographer, “and as soon as I
saw everything was O. K. I did the business. Knew just when the trigger
sprang, too, for I noticed her give a little jump at the click. Then she
flew off again as I stepped up to recover my camera that lay on the
ground. I certainly do hope I’ve struck a decent picture; but if not
I’ll just keep on trying till I do.”</p>
<p>“That’s the right spirit, Amos,” chuckled Elmer. “Just keep it up and
you’re bound to get there sooner or later.”</p>
<p>Then the newcomer had to be told about Perk’s thrilling adventure, as
well as shown the rattle of the dead snake by the proud victor in the
battle royal. The reader may rest assured that by the time all three
boys had given their separate version of the encounter, Amos was fully
posted regarding every detail possible.</p>
<p>“You came out of it in prime shape, Perk,” he said, heartily; “but luck
was on your side. If you’d happened to be a foot closer, there might
have been a far different story to tell; and a heap anxious lot of
fellows up here at Old Cabin Bend. I’ve known of chaps who were struck
by a rattler, and died in spite of being dosed with whisky, and such
things, under the idea that one poison can counteract another. For
myself I like to give snakes a wide berth. I’ll step out of the trail
every time to let one hold possession.”</p>
<p>“It’s really the safest plan,” assented Elmer.</p>
<p>“But that isn’t just all my news, boys,” continued the ardent
photographer. “Down under the river bank I found a heap of little
tracks, mink footprints for a certainty, showing that one old chap roams
around there, anyway. And to-night, Elmer, I’d like to have you help me
set my camera trap, hoping to coax Mr. Mink to sit for his own picture.”</p>
<p>“You can count on me in anything you ask, Amos,” he was told most
heartily as the roofers again got busy with their pounding.</p>
<p>After they had partaken of a light lunch, meaning to have the big meal
of the day come at evening, when their tasks would all be finished, they
lay around resting and dozing, for it had become quite warm.</p>
<p>Perk, however, showed signs of continued nervousness. Perhaps he had
received a greater shock during his encounter with the rattler than he
cared to admit; then again the suspicion that an escaped lunatic was
hovering around, and trying to spy upon them, was in itself quite enough
to make him uneasy.</p>
<p>He got up, and threw himself down again as many as half a dozen times,
considerably to the amusement of Wee Willie, who was slyly watching him.
Finally Perk found a seat on a convenient log, and sat there, staring
away toward a little uplift of land that might be called a forest knoll,
where the trees stood up far above the balance of the timber.</p>
<p>Wee Willie, watching, saw the fat chum suddenly start, and bending
forward stare very hard at something. His features were working, too, as
though Perk might be laboring under a fresh spasm of excitement.</p>
<p>“Well, I just expected it’d happen!” Wee Willie heard him mutter.</p>
<p>“What happened, Perk?” demanded the other, lifting his head.</p>
<p>“Why, there he is right now, perched in that beechnut tree up on the
knoll yonder. You can see the dark mass move if you look sharp! Of
course he’s spying on the camp; and I bet you he’s got it all fixed to
visit us this very night!”</p>
<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chVII' title='VII: The Climber of the Beech Tree'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER VII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>THE CLIMBER OF THE BEECH TREE</span>
</h2>
</div>
<p>“Ginger! there <i>is</i> something big and black up in that tree, as sure as
you live!” exclaimed Wee Willie, excitedly.</p>
<p>Both Elmer and Amos also stared. Apparently they found it necessary to
agree with what the tall chum had just said. It looked as though humble
Perk had scored again; somehow he seemed to be connected with almost
everything that had happened to them thus far; when as a usual thing
such events took delight in passing him by.</p>
<p>“There, didn’t you see him move?” he added, with a tinge of triumph in
his voice. “Just think of his nerve, climbing that tree to watch what we
do. If he’d been a signal-sender in the old Boy Scout days at Chester,
before the troop busted up, he couldn’t have picked out a better
location. I bet you he’s watching us right now. What ought we do about
it, Elmer?”</p>
<p>Considerably to the astonishment of the speaker, Elmer was heard to give
an unmistakable chuckle, as though something amused him.</p>
<p>“Well,” he went on to say, “we might walk out there and tell that party
we objected to his company; but the chances are he’d sniff at us, and
amble away; for you see it’s only <i>a bear</i>!”</p>
<p>“A bear!” gasped Perk, turning again to fasten his eyes on the
mysterious object perched high in the big beech tree.</p>
<p>“Yes, a black bear, and I reckon a half-grown cub at that, else he
wouldn’t be so fresh as to climb a tree so near our camp,” the other
continued; while Wee Willie nodded his head in affirmation, and hastened
to corroborate the statement by saying:</p>
<p>“No doubt about it, Perk, your hobo is a four-legged tramp, all right. I
c’n make him out plainly, now he’s moved a bit; though at first I began
to think it might be a man sitting astride a limb.”</p>
<p>“But what’s a bear doing up there, I’d like to know?” Perk objected,
hardly liking to give up his side of the case so easily.</p>
<p>“Why, from away back bears have been in the habit of climbing trees
whenever they felt like it,” the tall boy told him; “and there’s nothing
in the Constitution of the United States that’s going to make ’em change
their habits either—that is, black bears. It’s a different thing with
grizzlies out in the Rocky Mountain country, I understand; they keep to
the ground.”</p>
<p>Perk sighed with real relief as he hurriedly remarked, and quite
cheerfully at that:</p>
<p>“Well, I’m glad to know I was mistaken. It gave me a bad feeling to
think that ugly tramp was spying on us. Yes, now the thing shifts again,
and sure enough I can make him out plainly. It’s a real live bear—not a
monster, but pretty hefty for all that.”</p>
<p>Amos darted into the cabin.</p>
<p>“Now what’s he after, I want to know?” Perk quickly asked.</p>
<p>“Just as like as not, that camera of his,” Elmer explained. “Amos is
crazy on the subject of photography, and his first thought always is,
‘Will it make a striking picture?’ I reckon he thinks he might be able
to creep up close enough to snap that chap off, up in the beechnut
tree.”</p>
<p>Sure enough out came Amos on the run, and gripping his ready camera.</p>
<p>“I’d like to get him the worst kind, fellows!” he told them. “Some of
the boys at home will laugh at us when we tell them we actually saw a
black bear up in a tree. I’d make them feel like thirty cents if I could
hold up a photo of the happening, taken at closer quarters than this.”</p>
<p>“We’ll all go along, Amos,” suggested Elmer.</p>
<p>Possibly he fancied that the others might find their presence useful in
some way or other. It might be wise, Elmer even suspected, since the
rash photographer, in his burning desire to get a close view, might run
foul of the claws of Bruin, and need material assistance.</p>
<p>“Glad to have you,” agreed Amos, a faint smile coming on his usually wan
face; “but let’s hurry, please, because the bear might take a notion to
come down, and then my chance would be gone.”</p>
<p>“Follow me,” Elmer told him. “We’ve just got to swing around a bit so as
to come up to leeward, for he’d be apt to scent us if we kept straight
on down the wind.”</p>
<p>“Good boy, Elmer, you’re right!” commended Wee Willie.</p>
<p>“And now no talking except in whispers, with as little of that as
possible. We don’t want to have our walk for nothing, I imagine.”</p>
<p>With these words Elmer led off, the others trooping after him, Amos
coming next, then the tall chum, and fat Perk bringing up the rear, as
was ordinarily his custom.</p>
<p>They soon found themselves deep in the woods, with all sight of the big
beechnut tree on the knoll lost to them. But trust Elmer for having
fixed the location indelibly in his mind. Every step they took was
fetching them just that much closer to their goal; and while Wee Willie
also kept tabs on their progress, not once did he find occasion to enter
the slightest protest concerning the leadership of Elmer.</p>
<p>After about ten minutes of this sort of thing, the one in the van
stopped, and held up his hand. They seemed to be at the foot of the
knoll, judging from the lay of the land. Elmer parted some bushes that
hemmed them in, and, looking up, the others saw the very beech tree
toward which they had started.</p>
<p>There could no longer be the least doubt concerning the nature of that
dark object, for it was a young black bear. Whatever had tempted him to
climb the tree they could only guess; for at the time they discovered
him afresh the clumsy little animal was thrusting out his muzzle, and
seemed to be sniffing the air suspiciously.</p>
<div id='i070' style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-left:10.0%; width:80%;'>
  <img src='images/illus-070.jpg' alt='' style='width:100%' />
<p class='caption'>His method of descending the tree was exceedingly clumsy.</p>
</div>
<p>“He’s got a whiff of human presence near by, somehow or other,”
whispered Elmer; “do you think you could snap him off from here, Amos?”</p>
<p>“To be sure I can,” came the ready response, as the camera owner shifted
his position; and a few seconds later a sharp click announced that he
had done the work.</p>
<p>“He heard even that little sound,” announced Wee Willie, in a low tone,
“because I saw him give a start. Hurry and duplicate, Amos, for the
rascal means to come down.”</p>
<p>Sure enough the bear seemed to have decided to change his location, as
if growing uneasy after getting that suspicious waft of a scent his
instinct told him was hostile to his species.</p>
<p>His method of descending the tree was exceedingly clumsy when compared
with the clever actions of a gray squirrel while skimming the smooth
trunk with ease. Indeed, the bear acted very much like a boy would have
done, coming down stern first, and being very careful not to let go
above until sure of his footing on a limb below.</p>
<p>Amos kept busy snapping him off in various postures. He evidently meant
to make sure of having some extra fine pictures to show.</p>
<p>Perk meanwhile began to grow a little uneasy, and even plucked at the
sleeve of Elmer as he managed to say excitedly:</p>
<p>“What if he’d feel mad and start to tackle the bunch? We haven’t got
even a club or a hatchet along, come to think of it. Are black bears
inclined to be vicious, Elmer; will they bite and scratch like a
wildcat?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that, Perk,” chuckled the other. “They are most
harmless animals as a rule, hardly more dangerous than so many hogs in
the pasture. Besides, this is only a youngster; chances are he’ll run
for all that’s out as soon as he hits solid ground.”</p>
<p>“I’ll give a whoop, and help scare him off then,” suggested Perk,
picking up his courage again.</p>
<p>“Just as you please; and Amos here can snap him off while on the
gallop!” Elmer concluded.</p>
<p>The bear was now almost at the foot of the tree. Amos stepped out so as
to command a better position for covering the spot. He had just one more
exposure left, when the half dozen would be complete; and he wanted to
make sure this last would not be wasted.</p>
<p>Perk was waiting, getting redder than ever in the face with suspended
breath and no sooner did he discover that the young bear had reached the
ground than he let out a yell that might easily have shamed a Comanche
Indian. Of course, this started the timid beast off at a wild pace,
while Amos clicked his camera to prove that he had taken advantage of
the opportunity.</p>
<p>The last they heard of Bruin was the clatter amidst the brushes and
thickets as he scrambled madly through every obstacle to his progress,
only wild to get away from that point of danger.</p>
<p>Elmer and Wee Willie exchanged looks, and laughed good and hard.</p>
<p>“Never will stop short of three miles, believe me!” asserted the latter.
“I didn’t believe you had it in you to let out such a fiendish whoop,
Perk. But it paid us for coming over here, for now we can say with truth
we had an adventure with a wild bear, and that Amos here had to ‘shoot’
six times before the fight was finished.”</p>
<p>Amos looked decidedly pleased.</p>
<p>“I’ll have to call this my bear roll of film,” he suggested, patting his
camera affectionately, after the manner of those who are seized with the
photographic craze. “And out of the lot there must be several half-way
decent pictures. I never believed I’d get such a great chance as this.”</p>
<p>“Say, things are happening like hot cakes, seems to me,” Perk remarked,
as once more they turned their faces in the direction of the camp. “Why,
we hardly get through with one event before another comes crowding along
right at its heels. We’ve done considerable camping this summer, ever
since we started the Camp Fire Boys’ Club, but nothing like this ever
came along the pike.”</p>
<p>“Suits me all right!” Wee Willie declared, grinning. “I like excitement,
and just sitting around, loafing, never was my style of enjoying myself.
Why, I’m even hoping we’ll see something of this chap who was hanging
out in the cabin when we came along and squatted here.”</p>
<p>“Oh, wouldn’t it be a tough joke on us now if, when we got back, we
found he’d been there in our absence, and helped himself to lots of our
stuff?”</p>
<p>Perk, as he spoke, looked as though this might not be a groundless fear
after all, but Elmer only laughed at him.</p>
<p>“I’m going back another way, you notice, Perk. Every now and then we can
get glimpses of the cabin, with our fire burning in front, and so far
I’ve seen no sign of any intruder. Don’t worry about it. In three
minutes we’ll be home again.”</p>
<p>His prophecy came true, and Perk was relieved to discover that nothing
had mysteriously vanished during their brief absence from camp.</p>

</h2>
</div>
<p>The incident of the climbing black bear was closed around four that
first afternoon in camp. Altogether it had been productive of
considerable excitement, and amusement as well. The day, however, was
fated to see still further singular happenings before closing.</p>
<p>Elmer was inside the cabin “fussing around,” as he called it. He had
cleaned out the shabby old fireplace, making a few badly needed repairs,
so that the chimney might draw properly when they came to start a blaze
there evenings, wishing to gather around, and chat or sing as the humor
seized them.</p>
<p>Amos had wandered off again. He said it seemed to be a banner day with
him so that he felt inclined to roam about and possibly make a few more
discoveries that would be of value; which, of course, pertained to the
camera stunt only—he had thoughts for nothing else apparently.</p>
<p>Perk and Wee Willie were discussing the menu for supper when Elmer came
out of the cabin door, and approached them. He seemed to be holding
something in his hand, though neither of the other boys could quite make
it out.</p>
<p>“Well,” Elmer commenced saying, as he came up, “I think I’ve discovered
just why our tramp wanted to get back into the cabin again last night,
going all around twice, looking for an opening which he didn’t find.”</p>
<p>“That sounds interesting,” observed Perk.</p>
<p>“Tell us about it, Elmer,” the tall chum added; “and what under the sun
are you holding there in your hand?”</p>
<p>Elmer laughed softly.</p>
<p>“That’s the answer,” he hastened to say, and then held something up
before their eyes.</p>
<p>“Gee! what a funny knife!” exclaimed Perk.</p>
<p>“Where’d you run across it, Elmer?” demanded Wee Willie.</p>
<p>“The blade is open, you see, just as I found it,” explained the other.
“And it was sticking in a log close by the yawning fireplace. From the
odor that hangs about the blade, I reckon Mr. Tramp must have used it to
slice some plug tobacco, that black, tough kind, you know, for his old
pipe, and then thinking to use it again a little later on, just stuck it
into a log of the wall near his head.”</p>
<p>“Huh! our coming along sent him on the run into the bushes, and he clean
forgot all about his precious old knife—is that what you mean, Elmer?”</p>
<p>“Just so, Wee Willie; and missing his knife later he started to come
back to recover it. To such men a knife becomes as precious as—well,
Amos’s camera is to him; or your postage-stamp album might be to you,
Perk. Besides, you can see what an odd sort of a knife this one is.”</p>
<p>“I never saw one like it before,” Perk spoke up. “Why, besides the one
big strong blade it’s got a fork, and a spoon attachment, too. Fact is,
it could be used for a whole meal. Yes, and here’s even a corkscrew
along the back. What a queer knife it is, to be sure! I don’t wonder the
poor old hobo valued it.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps he’s carried it for years and years,” mused Wee Willie, “and
it’s his most treasured possession. I wish he had it in his greasy
pocket again.”</p>
<p>“But see here, boys,” Perk suggested, “how do we know but that it might
have been there for ever so long—mebbe since the cabin was in use before
that tragedy happened here, that I’ve heard the folks down Chester way
mention?”</p>
<p>Elmer and the tall chum exchanged meaning glances. They had supposed
that Perk knew nothing about that tragic event, and had agreed to “keep
mum” about it while in camp at Log Cabin Bend, lest he feel uneasy.</p>
<p>“Oh! that’s an easy thing to decide, Perk,” the former assured him. “If
you examine the blade you’ll find it’s clear of rust, though far from
bright. Now that couldn’t be the case if it had been exposed here for
years to the damp air, such as would blow into the cabin with the door
swung half-way open most of the time it’s stood empty.”</p>
<p>“I get you, Elmer; please excuse my dense ignorance,” said Perk
hurriedly. “Now I wonder whether he’s going to keep on hanging out
around here until he gets back his old knife?”</p>
<p>“We’ll have to put out a sign, and invite the chap to step up to the
captain’s office and prove property,” Wee Willie argued whimsically
after his fashion. “No questions asked, and no reward expected for
finding the lost trusty blade; only we’d like him to clear out, and
leave us alone. I’ve seen a bunch of tramps, and a mussy lot they are,
taken as a whole. I always try to get to windward of ’em when watching
how they manage to cook a meal in tomato-cans and such.”</p>
<p>“But we saw no sign of his having had a fire in the cabin,” Perk went on
to remark, reflectively; “and there wasn’t the first evidence of his
having made a bed out of brush. How do you account for that, Elmer?”</p>
<p>“Oh! he may have arrived only an hour before we did, and was so tired he
just lay down to smoke and rest,” came the ready answer; for Elmer
always seemed to have a faculty for meeting objections.</p>
<p>“What will you do with it?” continued Perk.</p>
<p>“I haven’t decided,” Elmer told him. “I may hit on a way to get it back
into the possession of the owner without hunting him up. Leave that to
me.”</p>
<p>“There’s Amos coming along,” Wee Willie added; “somehow he seems to be
looking a whole lot happier than this morning. It must have been his
success at snapping off the bear in the beechnut tree.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that was what did it,” Elmer agreed; though his brow clouded, for
this unexplained mystery that seemed to be always hanging over his
comrade, making him so unhappy, was beginning to worry him considerably;
he wanted to be of service to Amos, yet could not muster up courage to
break in upon the other’s reserve, since it would seem so much like
thrusting himself into business that did not at all concern him.</p>
<p>Amos was actually smiling as he approached, and few of the Chester boys
could truly say they had ever seen such a genuine look of delight on his
sad face.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” he burst out, excitedly, “I managed to get a
glimpse of Mr. Mink, the very first of his kind I ever had the luck to
see alive! Oh! but he’s a slick article, let me tell you, with his beady
little eyes, and soft furry hide. And I planned it all out just where we
ought to set the camera-trap to-night, Elmer, so’s to coax him to pull
the cord, and set the flashlight going.”</p>
<p>Elmer looked at him with affection. Somehow he had come to care a great
deal for Amos, which in one way was rather strange; for to most of the
fellows the newcomer in Chester had not appealed at all, owing to his
being such a moody fellow. But as is usually the case with such serious
persons, when his face did light up in a smile it was wonderfully
“fetching.”</p>
<p>“I reckon we’ll manage to get a picture of his Highness, King Mink,”
Elmer assured him; “when we’ve laid ourselves out to the limit. I know a
few tricks along those lines, which are quite at your service, Amos. But
see here, what a queer find I made in the old cabin.”</p>
<p>He held up the quaint pocket-knife as he said this, and the eyes of the
other became instantly focussed on it. To the astonishment, almost
consternation, of Elmer, he seemed to be immediately strongly affected
by the sight of the late property of the roving tramp.</p>
<p>Perk and Wee Willie also stared to notice how the face of Amos, actually
showing a dash of color when he first joined them, now suddenly became
as pale as that of a ghost. His breath came and went in gasps, though
apparently he was making desperate efforts to hold himself within
bounds, doubtless realizing how his startled companions must be
observing him.</p>
<p>“Where did you say you found it, Elmer?” he finally managed to say, in
what might be termed half gasps, while he could be seen swallowing
something that seemed to rise in his throat, and threaten to choke him,
poor fellow.</p>
<p>“Why, in the cabin there,” explained the other, hesitatingly. “It was
sticking in one of the logs forming the wall, between the little opening
used as a window and the big fireplace. I think the hobo must have used
it to cut up some hard plug tobacco, for it smells rank of the stuff;
and then carelessly thrust the point into the log, before our coming
frightened him away.”</p>
<p>“And, what do you think,” Perk now managed to add, “Elmer believes it
was to recover this old knife that the old tramp came back and walked
around the cabin twice last night, looking for a chance to get inside.
Too bad, isn’t it, Amos?”</p>
<p>Amos, however, seemed to pay scant attention to what Perk was saying.
His distended eyes were fastened on the article which still lay exposed
in Elmer’s open palm.</p>
<p>“But—couldn’t it have been there a long time, don’t you think?” he now
asked, as though clinging to a straw; “say as much as—six or seven
years?”</p>
<p>“I’m dead sure it hasn’t,” he was told positively. “In the first place,
other persons besides us have visited the old cabin here from time to
time, and some one would surely have found it. Then again, look how
smooth the steel of the discolored blade is; it must have rusted if it
had been exposed to the weather for even a few months. Oh! no, Amos,
whoever the tramp is, he surely put it where I found it, and this very
night.”</p>
<p>“I—guess you’re right, Elmer,” fell in trembling tones from the lips of
the other, still looking peaked and white. “W—would you mind my looking
at it?”</p>
<p>“Certainly not,” said Elmer, at the same time thrusting the queer knife
into the other’s hand, eagerly stretched out to receive it.</p>
<p>All of them could not help but notice how his hand trembled violently
from some sort of emotion as the fingers closed about the haft of the
knife. Evidently there was some element about the find of Elmer that
affected Amos Codling. He turned the knife over, and stared hard at the
buckhorn handle as though fairly fascinated, while the other three
watched him with surprise bordering on amazement.</p>
<p>While the trio continued to stand there gaping, Amos hastily thrust the
object back into Elmer’s hand. He almost acted as though shuddering at
its touch, and anxious to get it out of his possession.</p>
<p>“Guess—I’ll go and lie down for a bit,” he managed to say in a fairly
steady voice. “I’ve overdone it in tramping to-day, and feel worn out.
Don’t bother about me, boys; I’ll—be all right soon.”</p>
<p>With these words he stalked hurriedly into the cabin.</p>

</div>
<p>“Why, whatever can be ailing Amos?” Perk said softly, immediately after
the strange boy had vanished from view inside the cabin.</p>
<p>Elmer held up a warning finger.</p>
<p>“Whatever you say, speak in a whisper, boys,” he went on to remark.</p>
<p>“Gee whiz! but here’s another mystery looming up!” gasped Wee Willie.
“Why, Elmer, he seemed to recognize that old knife, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“It looked that way,” muttered the other, glancing toward the cabin with
a world of commiseration in his eyes, “and whatever the memories may be
it aroused, I’m afraid they couldn’t be happy ones.”</p>
<p>“Somebody he knew once owned such a knife, and he asked to see it so as
to make certain,” pursued the wise Wee Willie, reflectively. “Yes, and I
reckon he found the proof he was looking for, too. Let’s see the thing
again, Elmer.”</p>
<p>“I know what he found, all right,” the other assured him. “Here, you can
see that there are two letters roughly scratched on the buckhorn
handle.”</p>
<p>“What are the letters?” insisted the tall chum, who when interested in a
subject was a difficult one to make let go.</p>
<p>“No use trying to hide anything from you, Wee Willie,” Elmer replied.
“They are not fashioned very elegantly, for the handle is rough, you
see; but as near as I can make them out the letters are S. C.”</p>
<p>The elongated boy pursed his lips as if intending to whistle; but
evidently thinking better of it failed to emit a single sound.</p>
<p>“And his name, it’s Codling, remember,” he whispered, with a quick look
over in the quarter where the lone cabin stood under the big tree.</p>
<p>“Yes, that looks significant for a fact,” agreed the deeply interested
Perk, adding immediately afterwards, “Poor chap, I’m awful sorry for
him, no matter what the cause of his trouble may be. He was looking
quite happy, for him, as he told about that mink he discovered peeking
out of its hole under the bank; but when he saw the knife, and heard
what Elmer said, the smile froze on his face, you might almost say. I
wish I could help him some way.”</p>
<p>“None of us can do a thing until he makes the first move,” warned Elmer,
with a determined shake of his head. “I’ve felt this coming for some
time, and wished he’d make a confidant of me, but up to now he hasn’t
seen fit to do so.”</p>
<p>“Oh! what is that?” asked Perk, in almost awed tones.</p>
<p>“I think it must be Amos sobbing, and trying to keep his head down in
his blankets,” admitted Elmer, himself almost choking with the great
desire he felt to hasten in and try to comfort his friend. “But we must
pretend we don’t hear him. After a while he’ll feel better, and join us
again, for he’s got a heap of what you might call grit, likewise pride,
about him. Perhaps while we’re up here he may see fit to tell us his
trouble, and then we’ll be able to offer to help him, if it’s possible.”</p>
<p>Perk turned his face away. The others, knowing his tender heart, could
give a pretty good guess concerning what caused him to do so. Indeed,
Wee Willie himself had to wink quite violently for some reason or other,
and coughed as if he might be choking over something that compelled him
to drag out his big red bandanna handkerchief, and blow his nose
strenuously.</p>
<p>“Of course,” pursued Elmer, who had been trying to figure things out
most persistently, “it’s always possible that even if this is the same
knife Amos once knew, some utter stranger may have left it here. Such
things often pass through many hands in trade; or can even be stolen.
Tramps have no sense of honor, most of us believe.”</p>
<p>“A tramp, greasy and ragged perhaps—ugh! no wonder Amos shuddered when
he saw a picture of some one he once knew, perhaps even cared for,
looking like that,” Wee Willie muttered, with a doleful shake of his
head.</p>
<p>“Well, we must put it all out of our minds for the time being,” advised
Elmer. “Let’s not add to his suffering by showing him we’re curious. As
for the knife, I’ll replace it where I found it. I’ve got a little
scheme beginning to take shape that may bring results; and at least get
the thing back into the possession of the owner.”</p>
<p>Both Perk and the tall chum understood that this would be the wisest
course for them to pursue. Elmer knew best how to manage things; they
had always fared well whenever they trusted themselves to his guidance.</p>
<p>Presently the half choked sounds from within the cabin ceased.
Apparently the boy had managed to get control over his feelings,
whatever it may have been that caused such a tempestuous outbreak.</p>
<p>Perk and Wee Willie started preparing supper. The latter had tried
fishing earlier in the afternoon, with more or less success; so that
there was now a frying-pan filled with the results of his labor, and
ready to go on the fire. Perk fairly beamed with pride as he feasted his
eyes on the perch and bass, now nicely cleaned, and washed, and dusted
with flour, before being placed in the hot grease that oozed from the
salt pork in the pan.</p>
<p>Elmer found something to do that would keep him away from the cabin, for
he thought it best not to disturb Amos just then. The other would in
good time “get a grip” on himself, and be ready to face his chums again
without displaying unusual emotion.</p>
<p>He came out while supper was cooking, and while he tried to smile as
Perk called out and demanded to know if he recognized the origin of the
delightful odor that was beginning to permeate all the surrounding
atmosphere, it was hardly what might be called a success.</p>
<p>“It seems you did catch some fish after all, Perk,” he said in answer;
“and I must say they do smell appetizing,” but that was the extent of
his remarks, nor did either of the boys attempt to urge him to continue
talking.</p>
<p>Perk was full of consideration for Amos; on his part possibly Wee Willie
may not have been quite so solicitous; because curiosity was one of the
tall chum’s weak points, so that he found himself wondering more and
more what all this mystery, connected with the Codling boy, could
signify.</p>
<p>Supper time found them gathering around the camp spread. A bountiful
meal had been prepared, such as might make the eyes of the average
hungry boy fairly glisten with satisfaction.</p>
<p>Amos ate very little. He seemed to have quite lost his usually keen
appreciation for Perk’s cooking, a fact that worried the other
considerably; for he did his best to press this thing and that on the
other, though only to be greeted again with a gentle but positive
refusal.</p>
<p>“It’s awfully kind of you to offer me the choice bits, Perk,” Amos would
say, “and I’m sure everything does you great credit. I’d be only too
glad to eat like Wee Willie here, if only I felt hungry; but—well,
somehow I don’t seem to care much for anything to-night—I can’t force
myself, you know.”</p>
<p>But he did keep on sitting there, and listening to the merry chatter and
badinage of his three more boisterous chums, though frequently Elmer
could see that his eyes had a far-away look about them, and the old
peaked expression would struggle back to his face once more.</p>
<p>The boys had decided to sit around the fire that night, and sing some of
their school songs; but with Amos in this strange humor of course they
could not count on him to join in; and without his fine tenor the
singing was apt to prove only mediocre, so they gave it up.</p>
<p>“Perhaps by to-morrow night things may have changed for the better, and
we can try it out then,” Elmer remarked, after Amos had withdrawn, under
the plea that his head ached, and he thought he had better turn in
early.</p>
<p>So, instead, the other three sat there and talked in low tones as time
passed, with the night growing older. Perk often glanced quickly around
at the somber woods. Elmer could easily interpret that questioning look,
and knew that the other was wondering whether they might not have
another visit from the mysterious tramp whom they had alarmed by their
coming, and yet who declined to leave the spot, while some of his
personal property remained unrecovered.</p>
<p>There was no use trying to reassure Perk, for he happened to be more or
less timid by nature. The door had been made additionally secure during
the day just passed, so that no matter if the hobo did return he could
not enter. As for his showing ill humor in any way, such as trying to
set fire to the old cabin, Elmer would not allow such a thought to get a
lodging in his mind.</p>
<p>Then came the moon peeping in upon them, nearly an hour later than its
appearance the previous night, and looking somewhat battered along one
edge, showing how it was in its decline.</p>
<p>“Time we’re off to our blankets,” suggested Elmer. “Here’s Perk almost
dislocating his jaws every time he yawns. What’s the use of sitting up
any longer when we’ve got fairly decent beds of hemlock browse under
coverings waiting for us?”</p>
<p>In this he was supported by both his chums, so they all packed off into
the cabin, leaving the fire fixed so that it would burn for some hours.
If the wind arose Elmer meant to step out and make sure no sparks were
being blown into the underbrush; though at that summery time of year the
chances of a conflagration might be reckoned next to nil.</p>
<p>So the door was closed and secured, Perk and the elongated chum seen
safely into their blankets, and then Elmer himself took one last look
around before following suit. Amos seemed to be sound asleep; at least
his eyes were closed, and he was breathing easily. Elmer bent over and
adjusted the other’s blanket in a solicitous way. He did not know that
Amos opened his eyes and looked after him affectionately as he turned
away; or that there came a suspicious moisture trickling down the boy’s
cheek that was very like a tear.</p>
<p>Then darkness fell upon the scene, Elmer having shut off his little hand
electric torch after he had tucked himself under his own blanket.</p>
<p>The night passed without any sort of alarm, for which Perk told himself
he was very thankful as he again opened his eyes to find that it was
morning, with his comrades—at least two of them—already outside, talking
in low voices. Amos, however, still lay there, and seemed sound asleep.
Perhaps he had passed a restless night, and only forgot his trouble in
the hours of early morning.</p>
<p>Perk soon emerged from the shack and joined the others, who were making
preparations for breakfast. Elmer, after asking whether Amos seemed to
still be asleep, drew closer to the others and followed up his question
by saying:</p>
<p>“Well, my plan worked after all, boys. You remember I said I would try
to get the knife back into the possession of the tramp. I reckon that’s
where it is this morning!”</p>
<p>“However did you manage that, I want to know?” Perk demanded, plainly
surprised by what Elmer had said so quietly.</p>
<p>“Yes, open up and tell us the secret, that’s a good fellow,” Wee Willie
urged, as the two of them closed in upon Elmer.</p>
<div class='chapter'>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER X</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>AMOS DECIDES</span>
</h2>
</div>
<p>Apparently Elmer was ready to take the others into his confidence, for
he immediately began to explain what he had done.</p>
<p>“You remember that I said I’d put the knife back about where I found
it,” he told them; “which was close to that hole in the wall used for
air as a sort of window, alongside the chimney.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I saw that you had stuck its pointed blade in the log; noticed
that between yawns when I was getting ready to turn in,” admitted Perk.</p>
<p>“Well, it was gone this morning,” asserted the other, triumphantly.</p>
<p>“Yes,” objected Wee Willie instantly—they always said the tall chum
would make a good lawyer, he was so ready with his objections—“but how
do you know the tramp came back again and took it?”</p>
<p>“Who else would?” asked the puzzled Perk.</p>
<p>“Why, perhaps Amos got to thinking about it, not being able to sleep,
and for some good reason chose to lay hold of the old thing,” explained
Wee Willie blandly.</p>
<p>“Listen,” continued Elmer, with that quiet smile of his which the others
knew so well spoke of assurance, “I considered that point myself, and
fortunately there was a way open to prove my case. I’d smoothed out most
of those tracks around the cabin, but when I came out to take a look,
there they were again, showing the hobo had once more shown up.”</p>
<p>“Great work!” grunted the skeptical Wee Willie, now convinced beyond the
shadow of a doubt.</p>
<p>“Better still,” added Elmer, intent on rubbing it in while about the
job, “the marks led straight to that little window. You remember it’s
got a sort of shutter secured with a hasp inside; though air can come in
because of the slits between the slats. Now I purposely pried an end of
one slat loose.”</p>
<p>“What for, Elmer?” queried the wondering but admiring Perk.</p>
<p>“So any one who felt like it could thrust an arm through the gap, and
feel around inside,” Elmer told him.</p>
<p>“Jingo! what a bully scheme!” exclaimed Perk, grinning broadly; “for of
course the knife was within reach from the opening. Now I can see why
you feel so dead sure the persistent old tramp got his knife at last.
Say, it <i>does</i> pay to keep everlastingly at it, eh?”</p>
<p>“But why go to all that trouble just to please a Wandering George?”
exploded Wee Willie. “For one, I’d have been glad to keep that queer
contraption just as a curiosity, and so as to remember some of the
things that have happened to us up here at Log Cabin Bend.”</p>
<p>“Just what I didn’t want to have happen,” Elmer told him, sternly. “I
knew that as long as that thing was around, every time it bobbed up poor
Amos was bound to have a bad inning. Now it’s gone, he may forget more
or less about what it brought up in his mind.”</p>
<p>“Gee! what a mixup we’ve struck, all around,” muttered the tall chum,
rubbing his pointed chin after a habit he had when reflecting; and then
suddenly brightening up, he continued: “but we mustn’t let such little
things spoil our camping trip. Amos will get over it after a bit. We
must all try to keep him interested in things—oh! what about that
camera-trap business you two laid out to carry through last night?”</p>
<p>“Why to be sure,” Perk chimed in, “there’s that cunning Mr. Mink who
lost a good supper last night just because you forgot. And I went and
laid a nice fish-head aside for him.”</p>
<p>“You’re wrong there, Perk,” Elmer assured him, quietly. “It wasn’t
forgetfulness on my part; but Amos had gone to his blanket with a sick
headache, and I just couldn’t find the heart to disturb him. The trap
game will keep just as well for to-night. In fact, if it should happen
to be cloudy all the better, because it is on black nights such things
can be made a success. You see the camera must be left with the lens
exposed, so that when the flashlight is fired the exposure will be
complete.”</p>
<p>“Then how about daylight coming on, and finding it in that way, to spoil
the exposed plate or film?” queried Perk.</p>
<p>“Oh! the photographer crank has to keep that in mind,” explained Elmer.
“I understand experts in this line, who spend all their time and a heap
of money in the bargain going to strange sections of the earth, just to
get such pictures for their collection, have devised some sort of a
clever arrangement whereby the pull at the cord by the wild animal
releases the shutter of the camera, which closes again after a certain
length of time, protecting the exposed film against any light that may
come along, such as the rising sun.”</p>
<p>Just then the object of their conversation appeared, coming from the
cabin. Amos looked haggard and worn. Evidently he had passed a bad
night, and his three chums felt greatly concerned over it.</p>
<p>Still, as they had agreed to act quite natural, they tried not to let
him see what lay deep down in their hearts. Perk called out to him
cheerily, to ask some natural question, and Wee Willie followed it up by
saying:</p>
<p>“We were just asking Elmer about that mink you saw yesterday, Amos; and
he told us you’d certainly lay for him to-night. I never got close to a
shy mink, and hardly know what one looks like; so I sure hope you do
strike off a good picture of his Royal Highness. I give him that title,
you see, because his fine pelt has soared to what dealers call ‘abnormal
prices’ in the fur market.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Amos agreed, falling into Wee Willie’s pit, and showing something
of interest, “all furs reached stiff prices during the World War. You
see, so many who used to spend their winters trapping fur-bearing
animals, in America, Russia, and other countries, were called to the
colors, so the fur harvest dwindled terribly.”</p>
<p>“They say it’s an ill wind that blows nobody good,” chirped Perk; “and
what was hard on high-born ladies, and men who must have their fur-lined
overcoats, was a big boon to the poor little hunted four-footed
creatures who have to exercise all their intuitions so as to save their
own coats.”</p>
<p>“Why,” Wee Willie broke in, “right close by up in Muskrat Swamp around
the headwaters of our Beaverkill River they say the little beasts never
were one-half so plenty as this summer. I warrant you there’ll be many a
dollar picked up there next winter, when some fellows I know start in
trapping them.”</p>
<p>“Muskrat Swamp,” mused Perk, reflectively, “do you know I’ve never had
even a peep into that queer place, and it lying not much over twenty
miles away from Chester in the bargain. Some day I hope our crowd goes
up there to camp, and prowl around. I’d give a heap to see what a real
swamp looks like.”</p>
<p>“Not a bad idea, Perk!” called out Elmer, who had heard what was being
said, though up to then for reasons of his own he had not chosen to
break into the conversation, “and we’ll consider it later on. I’d like
to explore that place myself, though I reckon we ought to have a boat of
some kind to do the thing properly.”</p>
<p>Perhaps all of them would have been considerably astonished could they
have lifted the curtain of the immediate future, and discovered how soon
just such a glorious opportunity was fated to crop up, and beckon them.</p>
<p>Breakfast having been duly dispatched they set about the tasks of the
day. The mess of fish had tasted so fine on the preceding night that
Perk found little trouble about enlisting the services of Wee Willie in
an expedition looking to a second installment. They had dug some angle
worms, and soon departed for the nearby river.</p>
<p>“Don’t expect us back until near noon,” Perk called out, joyously.
“Usually the fish stop biting along toward midday, but if we have a mess
we’ll show up in time for lunch.”</p>
<p>“Don’t bother your head about that meal,” Elmer told him, “for it’s only
right some one should spell you. We don’t believe in running a willing
horse to death.”</p>
<p>“That’s white of you, Elmer,” Perk sent back over his shoulder, as he
trotted along by the side of the striding Wee Willie, taking two steps
to one for the long-legged chum.</p>
<p>Amos hung around the camp.</p>
<p>He pretended to be working with his camera, but Elmer noticed him
casting nervous glances in his direction from time to time. From this he
wisely concluded that Amos had something on his mind, and was waiting
until he could screw his courage up to the deciding point.</p>
<p>Knowing that it was the best thing to do Elmer simply went about his
duties, whistling softly to himself, and paying no particular heed to
Amos. If the other finally made up his mind to confide in him he felt
sure no act on his part was likely to hasten things along.</p>
<p>Doubtless the fact of the others being off for the morning had something
to do with the decision of Amos; since it gave him an opportunity to
talk with his best chum undisturbed.</p>
<p>An hour and more had gone. Still Amos sat there on the log. His camera
lay beside him, and the boy was bending forward, resting his head upon
his hand, his elbow against an adjacent tree.</p>
<p>Somehow his dejected attitude stirred Elmer to the depths and caused him
to change his mind. He felt that he must really make some move which the
other could interpret as an expression of sympathy. As Elmer told
himself: “If the mountain won’t come to Mahomet, then Mahomet must go to
the mountain,” which would be the same thing in the end. He walked over
to where Amos sat.</p>
<p>If the other heard his footfalls he gave no evidence of the fact save
perhaps a twitching of his free hand which lay on his knee. Elmer was
approaching from the rear. He hardly knew what he meant to do except to
come in personal contact with his chum. In times of trouble the touch of
a friendly hand may mean everything to the one in mental distress,
bringing fresh hope, and a renewal of the courage necessary to grapple
with difficulties.</p>
<p>So, reaching the other, Elmer put his hand on his drooping shoulder.</p>
<p>“Amos, can I help you in any way, old fellow?”</p>
<p>The words were boylike, but sincere, as though they welled straight up
from the heart of the speaker. They acted like a spur upon the quivering
lad, who sprang to his feet wildly, and clutching Elmer’s ready hand
squeezed it convulsively as he exclaimed in a voice broken with emotion:</p>
<p>“Oh! Elmer I just <i>can’t</i> stand it alone any longer! I didn’t want to
tell a living soul, but it’s too much for me, yes, far too much! And
I’ve made up my mind to explain what all this mystery means about that
queer knife. Elmer, it once belonged to—<i>my own father</i>, who’s been away
for seven years, and all of us have believed him to be dead.”</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XI</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>CLEARING SKIES</span>
</h2>
</div>
<p>Elmer continued to hold the other’s quivering hand firmly in his clasp.</p>
<p>“Try to control your feelings as much as you can, Amos, old boy,” he
went on saying in his comforting fashion. “And don’t tell me anything
that you may regret. You can depend on it, though, that I’ll respect
your confidence, and not even mention it to Perk and Wee Willie, without
your permission.”</p>
<p>“Oh! but I want them to know all about it too!” said Amos, looking up,
and winking his eyes violently, “because it’s only right. I hope, ever
so much, that you won’t despise me for s-s-sailing under f-f-false
colors, that’s all.”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing you have done, I’m sure of that, Amos,” said the staunch
chum, resolutely, “and that’s all we count. You’re not to be held
responsible for the actions of some one else. Now, go on and tell me
what you think best.”</p>
<p>He stepped over the log and sat down, drawing Amos alongside. Throwing
an arm about the other’s shoulder, Elmer waited to hear the sad story,
which in truth he could already more than half guess.</p>
<p>“Is it all about some trouble your father got himself into, Amos?” he
asked, seeing that the other hardly knew just how to begin.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, that’s it!” sighed Amos. “My father was never known to do
mean things, but he certainly did slip up once, and everything came from
that terrible mistake. Just like a good many others do who are tempted,
he took money that didn’t belong to him, expecting to put it back when a
certain deal was carried through; but something happened that turned the
tide the wrong way, and he found himself—a defaulter!”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Elmer, soothingly, “it is a sad thing for you to remember;
since you must have cared a great deal for your father, judging from
what you say, and how you still suffer.”</p>
<p>“I loved him, we all did, for up to that time he had always been good to
us,” Amos confessed. “It was in hopes of bettering the condition of his
family that tempted him to do that terrible thing, too, mother has said
since, a thousand times.”</p>
<p>“He went away, you said, didn’t you?” continued Elmer, when the other
paused as if lost in contemplation of the distant past.</p>
<p>“Yes, to avoid being arrested, and bringing shame on his family,” came
the answer. “I shall never forget that awful day as long as I live,
though I was pretty young then, hardly ten. It came like a hurricane out
of a clear sky, father showing up, and looking almost crazy, telling
mother all about it, and that he must go away to try to redeem himself.</p>
<p>“He left her all the money he had, and told her to take us children to
an old aunt of hers, who had means. Father vowed that he would make no
attempt to communicate with her, or ever come back, unless he could
square himself with the firm whose confidence he had abused.</p>
<p>“From that terrible day to this we have never once heard from him.
Mother fully believes he has long been dead. She often talks of him to
me as we sit in the gloaming, and her thoughts go back to the happy days
of her young married life. I have his gold watch, left for me, but
which, of course, I shall not carry until I am grown up and in business.</p>
<p>“The old aunt died shortly after we came to live with her, and left her
property to my mother, whom she dearly loved. It was enough to keep us
fairly comfortable, though we have to count the dollars; and I may yet
have to leave school and go to work, so as to help out.</p>
<p>“There, now you know everything, Elmer; do you think you still care to
be chummy with the son of——”</p>
<p>“Stop right there, Amos!” commanded Elmer, gruffly, for he was in
reality almost choking with emotion himself in sympathy with the poor
chap at his side, who wanted so to cling to him, and yet determinedly
pushed himself away, as if feeling not worthy to associate with fellows
upon whose heads no such dark shadow rested. “If anything, you’re more
my chum than ever. A pretty pal I’d be to hold back when you’re in need
of sympathy. And both Perk and Wee Willie will say the same thing, you
can bank on it.”</p>
<p>Amos drew a long lingering breath as of intense relief. He also seemed
on the point of breaking down again, seeing which Elmer hastened to add:</p>
<p>“Now brace up, old fellow, and begin to believe things may not be
<i>quite</i> so black as they seem. One thing you can depend on, that not a
living soul in all Chester will ever know about your trouble through any
of us. We’ll keep your secret, and not even drop a hint to our folks at
home. You’re certain about that knife once being your father’s, are you
Amos?”</p>
<p>“Oh! absolutely!” exclaimed the other; “I’d know it anywhere, for it
used to be a great wonder to me. Besides, I saw his initials scratched
on the handle, just as in the old days. Father had owned that knife a
long time, and used to think a heap of it.”</p>
<p>Elmer remembering how the unknown tramp had hung around all this time
just to recover the knife, could not help feeling that the present
possessor must also have considerable affection for the thing, whoever
he might turn out to be.</p>
<p>“But during seven years it could easily have fallen into other hands,
you understand,” continued Elmer. “It might have been lost, or stolen,
in fact, passed through a variety of adventures by now.”</p>
<p>“I think you mean to say that if my father died some one with him at the
time would have taken possession of the knife,” remarked Amos, again
drawing a long breath; “which is perfectly true. I am not saying that I
believe the tramp to be my poor unfortunate dad; but it was the sight of
the knife turning up in this queer way after all these years that
unnerved me so.”</p>
<p>“What sort of a man was your father, Amos—I mean did he happen to be
tall, or short; and was he athletic or otherwise?” continued Elmer,
evidently with some object in view; at least the other suspected as
much, for he turned to look inquiringly into his face before answering.</p>
<p>“Why,” Amos went on presently, “you see, he never could play football or
baseball when a boy because he had one leg a bit shorter than the other.
This didn’t interfere with his walking at all; because I’ve tramped many
miles alongside him, for we were always—quite—chummy.”</p>
<p>“Was it his left leg that was the shorter?” pursued Elmer.</p>
<p>“That isn’t just a guess, is it?” demanded the other; “you seem to know,
Elmer! Tell me what it means, oh! please do!”</p>
<p>Elmer looked at him rather uncertainly. Then, as if making up his mind
he had no business to hold back anything from a chum, he went on to
explain.</p>
<p>“You know I pride myself somewhat on my woodcraft knowledge, Amos; and
it was easy for me to discover that the unknown—er, party who has been
hanging about our camp here, hoping to recover that knife, had a short
left leg; for his right foot always showed much more plainly than the
other.”</p>
<p>Amos groaned.</p>
<p>“Then it is he!” he muttered. “Poor dad, and poor mother! Oh! what
wouldn’t I give, if I had never been tempted to come up here with you to
Log Cabin Bend. Then perhaps I’d still be contented in believing that he
had long ago ceased to suffer in body and mind.”</p>
<p>“Will you tell your mother when you go back home, Amos?”</p>
<p>“Had I better, do you think?” he asked, almost desperately.</p>
<p>“You must settle that for yourself, Amos. Think it over before you
decide one way or the other. Your first consideration should be the
happiness of the mother you love so much. Will it do any good to share
your secret with her; or must it reopen old wounds that time has partly
healed?”</p>
<p>“That’s it!” muttered Amos, shaking his head sadly. “I know how she will
begin to lie awake nights again like she did before, and look so
sorrowful, always watching down the road as if half hoping to see him
come limping along, waving his hand to us, as he did every night when
returning from the office. Yes, I mustn’t be rash: I would cut my hand
off sooner than do a thing to make my mother cry as she used to years
ago.”</p>
<p>Elmer began to see that possibly it might be up to him to try to get in
touch with the tramp, and learn just who and what he was. He could
understand what a cruel shock it must be to Amos even to suspect that
his father could reach the low level of a common wanderer on the face of
the earth, a hobo!</p>
<p>“You meant it when you said you wanted Perk and Wee Willie to know about
this matter, did you, Amos?” he asked presently.</p>
<p>“Yes, I insist on it,” said the other, hastily. “I’m tired of sailing
under false colors. If my chums all know my sad story it must be up to
them to decide whether they want to keep up their contact with me, or
drop me. But you must tell them, Elmer; I couldn’t have the heart to go
over it all again.”</p>
<p>“I promise you I will, now you’ve given me permission, Amos; and make
your mind easy. I know both of our pards too well to doubt what they’ll
surely do. They may not be able to say much, but their actions will
speak louder than words.”</p>
<p>“You’re all the finest chums any one could ever have, and it’d nearly
break my heart if you turned back on me. Do you know, I’ve had the
queerest things flit through my mind while thinking it all over.”</p>
<p>“Such as what, Amos?”</p>
<p>“For one thing I would picture my father crouching in the bushes off
yonder and staring hard at us while we sat around the campfire last
night, yet not daring to join the circle. I even wondered, Elmer,
whether he could recognize me, for I’ve changed a lot in these seven
years, of course; and how he must have felt at not being able to make
himself known, just because he thinks that old charge still hangs over
his head.”</p>
<p>“But doesn’t it?” demanded Elmer, suddenly thrilled somehow.</p>
<p>“Why, of course not,” said Amos, simply. “When mother came into the
property of her old aunt, one of the first things she did was to have an
interview with the head of the firm my father used to be with. She found
out the amount of his defalcation, and paid it. That was what cut down
our allowance so, and made us scrimp sometimes; but my mother always
gloried in clearing his name. Oh, if he is only alive, and could learn
that, what might not happen?”</p>
<p>“Courage, Amos!” said Elmer, “you’ve boosted the game a heap in telling
me that.”</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>SETTING THE TRAP</span>
</h2>
</div>
<p>Already Amos was looking much better. The hope that Elmer dangled before
his wondering eyes grew in proportion to his ability to grasp its
possibilities.</p>
<p>If it turned out that his wandering father were really in the vicinity,
surely some way could be found to get in touch with him, so that he
might learn how the cloud on his name had been wiped out years ago, and
that he might have come back to his dear ones, if only they had had any
clue concerning his whereabouts.</p>
<p>The two boys sat there on the log for almost an hour, talking, and
trying to form some plan whereby this could be effected. Elmer had found
the best medicine in all the world for his chum’s uplifting; Amos no
longer looked as discouraged as before, and even laughed a little at
something humorous the loyal companion related for this very purpose.</p>
<p>Elmer, too, was greatly relieved. Why, after all, the situation was a
whole lot better than he had dared hope. He became possessed of an
overwhelming ambition to find the tramp, and bring him the joyous news.
Already in imagination Amos was picturing the joy that would fill his
mother’s heart if the wanderer could only be brought back home again,
after doing penance so long for his delinquency.</p>
<p>Afterwards Amos took to making little excursions through the neighboring
timber on one excuse or another, though it was not difficult for Elmer
to understand that he indulged in a wild hope a voice might call to him
from out of some copse, and his father appear in sight, unable to resist
the longing to meet his boy once more.</p>
<p>But no such happy event came to pass, though Amos continued his walks,
so as to scour the neighborhood in every direction.</p>
<p>During one of his absences from camp Perk and Wee Willie came in,
bearing quite a noble string of perch and bass and catfish, which they
had succeeded in catching through persistent efforts.</p>
<p>Elmer took advantage of the opportunity while Amos was away to tell the
two others the whole story as related to him.</p>
<p>Of course, they were both intensely interested, and frequently
interrupted the narrative to express their sympathy for the comrade in
distress, as well as to vow that not a word of it all should pass their
lips.</p>
<p>“But, say, it may not be so bad after all,” Wee Willie hastened to
remark, when it had been told. “If the amount taken has been made good
then there can be no charge against Mr. Codling, and he could walk down
the street of the city where they used to live without being bothered
anyway. But then, to be sure he doesn’t know about this, and still
believes the Law is looking for him.”</p>
<p>“It cuts Amos to the quick to fancy his father as a common vagrant,”
continued Elmer. “Never mention that part of it to him if you happen to
be speaking about these things.”</p>
<p>“Huh!” mused Perk, pursing up his mouth thoughtfully, “I reckon the
world has kept on treating Mr. Codling rough all these years. The
prosperity he went off to find never came his way, and by degrees he’s
given up all hope, as these hoboes nearly always do, trying to forget
the past, so I’ve understood. Do you think he could be rounded up,
Elmer?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to try to make it come out that way,” was the quick reply,
“although I don’t know yet just what plan I’ll adopt. Once we got in
touch with him it would be easy, I guess. He might try to hold out,
ashamed to have the wrong wiped out through his wife, and not by his own
efforts; but he couldn’t fight long against being towed into a safe
harbor, after seven years of roving and up against hard times.”</p>
<p>“I hear Amos whistling as he comes along,” said Wee Willie just then;
“and it’s really the first time he’s done such a thing since we started
on this camping trip. Shows he must be feeling a heap better already.”</p>
<p>“He is,” said Elmer, as he broke away from the two who were cleaning
their string of fish, with the intention of having some of them for the
midday meal.</p>
<p>“Because,” explained Perk, sagaciously, “fish ought to almost jump from
the water into the frying-pan; you can’t get them too fresh to please
me. And, say, I do just love ’em to beat the band!”</p>
<p>During the balance of the day they found numerous things to claim their
attention, as is always the case when fellows who know the game are in
camp. For instance, Wee Willie claimed that he was tired of eating off
the ground, and proposed making some sort of rude but serviceable table
that would be much more homelike.</p>
<p>“And while you’re doing that job,” Amos told him, “perhaps Perk and
myself could hatch up some kind of seats to use when we have to stay
indoors, and can’t squat on these two logs.”</p>
<p>This idea pleased Perk very much, for if there was one thing he liked,
and felt bound to have whenever possible, it was solid comfort.</p>
<p>“I never did see the sense of making a martyr out of yourself all the
time you happened to be away from home, and in the woods,” he observed
sagaciously when on the subject; “so some fellows might call me a sissy,
or an old maid because I insist on fetching along certain things like my
tooth brush, and a few more necessities.”</p>
<p>“Huh! like this, for instance, I suppose?” chuckled Wee Willie,
appearing at the door of the cabin just then, and holding up an object
which caused Elmer to laugh outright, and even Amos to smile
indulgently.</p>
<p>“Oh! That’s my trousers’ creaser and stretcher,” blandly admitted Perk,
with a grin; “but honest to goodness I never meant to fetch it along;
and I don’t see how ever it got among my traps unless my sister Sue did
it; she’s as full of mischief as an egg is of meat, and would think it a
good joke on me to find what I’d gone and lugged all the way into the
woods. Think of me creasing this horrible pair of pants, will you?”</p>
<p>So they acquitted honest Perk of any evil intention along the line of
playing the dude when in camp. But of course Wee Willie would lose no
opportunity to plague him about his “stretchers” while they were at Log
Cabin Bend.</p>
<p>During the early afternoon Elmer disappeared.</p>
<p>He had told no one of his intention, and indeed they did not really miss
him until he had been gone some time.</p>
<p>“Where do you think he’s off to?” Perk asked the tall chum, for he had
left Amos to complete a rude chair upon which they were working, and
strolled over to where Wee Willie was putting the finishing touches on
their dining-table, an exceedingly rustic affair, but which promised to
be fairly serviceable.</p>
<p>“Oh! that’s an easy one,” replied the other, in a low tone, and with a
cautious look toward Amos. “You remember he said he meant to try to
locate the man with the queer knife, if he chanced to be still hanging
around in this neighborhood.”</p>
<p>“But why should he stay, now he’s got back his property, eh, Wee
Willie?” persisted the stout boy.</p>
<p>“Huh! that’s harder to answer, I admit,” he was told; “unless he did
chance to recognize Amos while we sat around by the blaze of the
campfire, and has been unable to tear himself away. But I leave that to
Elmer; if any one can unearth the tramp he will.”</p>
<p>“He nearly always does succeed in anything he undertakes,” assented
Perk, with a charming display of blind confidence in the absent chum.</p>
<p>Elmer did not come back for nearly two hours, and even then he gave them
no hint as to whether or not he had met with any sort of success in his
scouring of the timber in search of the mysterious lurker. Perk was for
asking him, but Wee Willie displayed his accustomed shrewdness when
advising against such a course.</p>
<p>“If Elmer wants to share anything with us depend on it he will, Perk;
and until he makes a move that way we’d better keep mum,” was what he
told the other; and Perk, easily influenced, must have thought it good
enough advice to follow, for he made no effort to “pump” Elmer.</p>
<p>They had their supper, and some time later Elmer, turning to Amos,
remarked:</p>
<p>“How about that camera-trap business, Amos; feel like sauntering over to
the bank where you glimpsed that cunning old mink, and setting things up
for getting a snapshot of the timid hermit?”</p>
<p>Amos jumped to his feet instantly, his eyes glistening.</p>
<p>“I certainly would like to, Elmer, thank you; and so I’ll hustle and get
my outfit, camera, flashlight pan, and all the apparatus necessary.
Perhaps I startled the old chap when I looked in on him; but by now he’s
had plenty of time to get over his scare.”</p>
<p>“How about you, Perk?” continued the leader; “you saved one of those
fish-heads as I asked you to, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“Three of ’em, Elmer; you’ll find them dangling by a string from that
limb of the hickory sapling yonder.”</p>
<p>“We’ll toss the others as far away from camp as we can,” continued
Elmer; “else we may be bothered with an army of ’coons fighting each
other while trying to locate the prize their scent tells them is around
here.”</p>
<p>He and Amos started off, and were soon at the spot. A creek, it seemed,
ran into the Beaverkill at that point, and it was really under the bank
of this the hermit mink lived in a hole that doubtless had many side
passages.</p>
<p>Elmer examined the ground thoroughly, and then they decided just where
it would be best to place the camera trap. The pan and flashlight
cartridge could lie flat on the ground just alongside, and the cord that
upon being jerked would cause the firing of the flashlight ran out to a
certain point that Amos said would be in exact focus.</p>
<p>All these preparations were carried out with as little noise as
possible, the boys seldom communicating while at work save in whispers;
for they did not wish to frighten the timid game, doubtless at the time
deep down in his burrow under the rocks and earth of the creek bank.</p>
<p>Finally everything necessary had been carried out. Amos went over it all
for the last time, and concluded that he could not better the
arrangements in any possible manner.</p>
<p>Accordingly they left the spot, Amos with the avowed intention of being
out at first peep of dawn so as to make sure the shutter of the camera
was closed before sunlight could destroy the result of their clever
trick.</p>
<div class='chapter'>

</h2>
</div>
<p>Because Amos was feeling much more cheerful they sang some that night.
Perhaps the great woods up at Log Cabin Bend had never before echoed
with the rare melody of four boyish voices. The little four-footed furry
denizens of the forest must surely have listened in sheer amazement to
catch the unwonted sounds floating through the leafy aisles, and
believed that their solitude was indeed a thing of the past.</p>
<p>It was mostly rollicking school songs, intermingled with some of the
popular military airs of the war time that they favored. Elmer saw to it
that in no case did they switch to anything that had a touch of sadness
about it. He wanted Amos to forget his troubles as much as possible, not
hug them to his heart.</p>
<p>Fortunately it proved to be a peaceful night, with no trace of coming
storm, which was a good thing for the photographic experiment.</p>
<p>At peep of dawn, Elmer waked just in time to catch a glimpse of Amos
stealing out of the cabin, he having managed to get the door open
without making much noise. Although Elmer raised his head he did not
utter a sound to let the other know he had been observed; for he knew
very well that Amos had his camera in mind, and was heading for the spot
where it had been set ready for Mr. Mink.</p>
<p>On the return of the other bearing his apparatus Elmer was up and
outside getting the fire started. It needed no question on his part to
decide that some sort of success had come to the ardent photographer.</p>
<p>“He visited the trap, Elmer, for a fact!” Amos was saying, his face
showing signs of considerable satisfaction. “The flashlight had burned;
and then too the fish-head bait was gone. I think he managed to work it
clear of the cord; but he deserved it, sure he did, the cunning little
varmint. Oh! I’m fairly wild to see what I got out of it!”</p>
<p>“Hold your horses until we’ve had breakfast, Amos,” the other advised
him. “Then you can have the cabin to work in, when you start developing.
I wouldn’t be at all surprised to find you’d made a big hit.”</p>
<p>“I used to think once I cared a heap to wander the fields with a gun,
and if I could only fetch home some game in my bag, a rabbit, partridge,
gray squirrel, or quail I felt might proud of my skill; but I can
plainly see I’ll never again find any happiness in killing. This sort of
hunting with a camera has got it all beat to a frazzle.”</p>
<p>“The beauty of it is,” remarked Elmer, “that you can still be on
friendly terms with the little animals of woods and swamp, and at the
same time secure your greatest triumphs. If that picture turns out good,
I reckon you’ll take ten times as much pleasure showing it, than if
you’d trapped the mink, and had taken his poor little pelt to sell for a
few dollars.”</p>
<p>“Oh! I’m sure of that, Elmer. And I can see that there are really
unlimited possibilities about this wonderful game. Just think how proud
a man might be if he had an album crowded with such pictures, which he
had collected all over the world, showing animals and birds in their
native haunts, yes, telling how they lived, and reared their young. I
guess the disease has got a firm hold on me, and I’ll never go back to
hunting with a gun again.”</p>
<p>Other boys than Amos Codling have discovered the same thing; and many an
innocent little creature living in the haunts of the wilderness owes its
continued existence to the lure and fascination to be found in hunting
with a camera.</p>
<p>When Amos came out of the cabin, after being shut up there an hour or
more, he was looking decidedly pleased.</p>
<p>“It turned out gilt-edged, Elmer!” he exclaimed, holding up something
with an air of considerable pride. “And, believe me, this negative is so
strong it’s bound to make a splendid print. You can see what looks like
an expression of surprise on the mink’s phiz when that dazzling flash
came. Yes, and he’s tugging at the string we tied the fish-head to, for
all that’s out!”</p>
<p>Each of the others took a look, and decided that it was indeed a prize
negative. Considering the fact that it had been secured under such
strange conditions, the contrasts were remarkably clean cut.</p>
<p>Amos was much encouraged by his initial success. Already he was
doubtless laying ambitious plans looking to further triumphs along the
line of what he was pleased to style “auto-photography,” because each
sitter must of necessity snap off his own picture.</p>
<p>Still, as the morning advanced Elmer could not help noticing that now
and then Amos would allow his gaze to wander to this or that point.
Perhaps he may have been figuring out his next step in the campaign; but
Elmer, noting the anxious expression once more upon the other’s face,
decided that Amos was thinking of his father.</p>
<p>Perk had developed a sudden interest in woods lore. Up to then this
subject had never interested him to any extent; in fact, he had been
more apt to display concern over a rabbit in the pot, than one bounding
over its native heath.</p>
<p>He now learned that there was a world of deeply instructive things to be
picked up in connection with all these smaller creatures. Once Elmer and
Wee Willie, that afternoon, began to give up some of the knowledge they
had acquired, Perk started a flow of questions that seemed capable, like
the poet’s brook, of “running on forever.”</p>
<p>The boys were good-natured, and really felt disposed to encourage Perk
in his pursuit of knowledge. It might be a turning point in the career
of easy-going Perk. Curiosity, along these lines, once aroused awakens
interest, and begets a desire to know more and more, until all animated
nature takes on a new and lively character.</p>
<p>“Well, now,” for one thing Perk remarked, “I’ve seen a rabbit start
running when I crossed a field, and then act queer, as if suddenly lame.
Yes, I can remember chasing bunny, and nearly overtaking the little
bunch with the cottontail; when all at once it’d spin away like
lightning, leaving me out of breath, and feeling foolish. So that was
all a sharp trick, was it, Elmer?”</p>
<p>“A very common one, played by mother partridges as well as rabbits,” he
was assured. “It was done just to draw you away from that clump of
grass, out of which the bunny jumped in the start. If you’d gone there
you’d have found a nest of young rabbits too small to escape. The mother
was ready to risk her own life in order to save her babies.”</p>
<p>Perk was deeply impressed.</p>
<p>“Why, I wouldn’t have hurt one of them for anything,” he insisted; “but
then the old lady couldn’t know that, could she? To think of such
devotion even in an humble bunny! Why, it would shame a good many human
parents, that’s right. And you say partridges do something the same,
eh?”</p>
<p>“A common trick,” Wee Willie hastened to remark. “Many a time in the
summer, or early in the fall before hunting time came, I’ve had a bird
suddenly flutter out on the woods trail before me, and act as if she had
a broken wing. I used to chase after her at first, until I got wise to
her sly trick. She’d let me almost grab her, and then just flip on a
little further, all the while luring me ahead; then all of a sudden
she’d recover the use of that broken wing and go off with a buzz.”</p>
<p>“And did you find young partridges where she came from?” pursued Perk,
with round eyes, and partly open mouth, as though he had begun to
experience a forerunner of the strange fascination that a knowledge of
all these wonderful things has for the lover of the Open.</p>
<p>“Lots of times,” Wee Willie promptly replied; “but I give you my word
for it, I was never guilty of trying to knock over a single one of the
frightened brood when they scattered like crazy little things. Later on,
I even refused to bother ’em in the least; though when the season opened
I would take my gun, and hunt as well as the next one.”</p>
<p>“Gee! I wish I could sight something like that,” Perk was saying. “Do
you think there are partridges around this place, Wee Willie?”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard ’em drumming more’n a few times, Perk; and Elmer here said
he’d flushed several when roaming around.”</p>
<p>“But would any mother bird be apt to have her brood so late in the
summer, do you expect?” continued the other persistently; for when an
idea did find lodgment in Perk’s brain it stuck most stubbornly.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised, for they say this was a late season, on
account of so much rain early in the summer, that drowned out lots of
nests. We might be lucky enough to run across one of these
self-sacrificing old mother birds while up here at Log Cabin Bend.”</p>
<p>“Huh! hope I’m along if it does happen,” grunted Perk. “I never dreamed
that you could learn such queer and interesting things just by keeping
your eyes and ears open when in the woods. After this I’m going to
investigate for myself. Seems like I’d just begun to scrape the scales
off my eyes; for, say, I must have been blind never to have paid any
attention to these things before.”</p>
<p>Elmer was delighted to hear Perk say this. He had himself tried more
than a few times to get the other interested in those very things, but
without success. Just what it was that had finally turned the trick he
could not say. Perhaps the hour had struck for Perk to wake up; then
again the sight of Amos beaming with joy over the success of his night
effort may have set the match to Perk’s slumbering ambition. No matter
what the cause, Elmer was vastly pleased at the result.</p>
<p>The boys were not idle by any means as the day passed on. They found
numerous things to occupy their time and attention. Some of these tended
to improve the conditions; little conveniences were arranged as
conceived, which were calculated to lighten the burden of getting meals;
or else render their sleeping accommodations more comfortable.</p>
<p>So the afternoon began to wane.</p>
<p>Wee Willie and Elmer had been observing a perceptible change that was
coming over the weather. In fact the day had been unusually hot, even
for late summertime, and after summing up various portentous facts the
weather sharps came to the conclusion that before another dawn they were
likely to have a chance to test the rainproof qualities of their newly
patched cabin roof.</p>
<p>“Something brooding, that’s certain,” Wee Willie asserted, as he mopped
his perspiring brow, having been chopping wood a short time before, with
the result that the perspiration was standing out in beads.</p>
<p>“Did Perk go fishing again?” asked Elmer; “I’ve missed him for some time
now.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so,” the other replied, “for there’s his jointed rod
standing over against the cabin right now. I remember seeing him walk
off; and come to think of it he went toward the east, and the river lies
to the west here.”</p>
<p>They looked at each other, with a growing uneasiness.</p>
<p>“Ten to one,” asserted Wee Willie, “Perk’s gone off on a little tramp in
hopes of starting a mother partridge whirring before him. You know what
he is when he gets any sort of notion in his head.”</p>
<p>“But we ought to have warned him against doing that,” Elmer hurriedly
said, “remembering how one of his besetting sins has always been to get
lost!”</p>
<p>With the prospect of a storm ahead they saw reason to feel concerned
over Perk’s continued absence.</p>

</h2>
</div>
<p>“I’m afraid we’re in for trouble about Perk, Elmer,” the tall chum
observed, his freckled face set in a frown.</p>
<p>“Nothing serious, so far,” he was told, for Elmer did not believe in
“conjuring up ghosts” as he termed Wee Willie’s habit of anticipating
calamities that might never come to pass. “Plenty of time still for Perk
to come in before we start getting supper; and besides the storm hasn’t
shown a sign so far.”</p>
<p>“But we know how easy it always has been for Perk to lose his bearings
in the woods,” persisted the other camper. “Many a time before now we’ve
had to go out and locate him. Seems as if Perk never will learn how to
take care of himself.”</p>
<p>“He’s just waking up,” remarked Elmer; “and may surprise some of us yet,
once he gets started. Still, it wouldn’t do any harm to give an
occasional shout. If he hasn’t got beyond earshot it might help him
locate the camp again.”</p>
<p>“I second the motion; and here goes for a starter.”</p>
<p>With that Wee Willie lifted up his strong voice, and gave a shrill yell
that could doubtless have carried a mile away. Amos came hurrying out of
the cabin as if wondering what was going on. He seemed relieved to find
his two chums standing there.</p>
<p>“Why, you did give me such a start!” he declared. “I even thought that
lunatic might have hopped in, and tackled Wee Willie. What’s all the
shouting for?”</p>
<p>“Perk’s wandered off again, and we thought he might stray away, so we’re
meaning to take turns in letting out a bazoo whoop to guide him this
way,” explained Wee Willie, with a grin. “If he was within a mile I
reckon he heard that clarion call of mine, eh, Amos?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and it ought to tell him which way the cabin lies,” returned the
other, confidently. “But we must keep it up, for Perk, even if he
started right, would be apt to swing to the left, like most fellows do
in the woods when they haven’t learned the trick of keeping a direct
line.”</p>
<p>“Every three minutes by the watch one of us must shout,” decided Elmer.</p>
<p>This program was kept up for half an hour. Several times they would
fancy there was a more or less feeble response, so that the shouting was
quickly resumed; but after straining their hearing to the utmost they
finally felt compelled to admit that this must have been only a vivid
imagination.</p>
<p>“I sure heard something answer that last yell,” Wee Willie affirmed,
stubbornly; “but then it may only have been an owl up in some old dead
treetop; or a cawing crow some distance away.”</p>
<p>“How long ought we keep this thing up, Elmer?” inquired Amos.</p>
<p>“Not more than another half hour,” came the reply.</p>
<p>“And if nothing happens then?”</p>
<p>“We’ll have to start out and try to locate Perk,” he was told.</p>
<p>“I saw him leave camp, and he went that way,” with which Amos pointed to
a certain quarter; at which Wee Willie nodded, and hastened to add:</p>
<p>“Yes, I was telling Elmer here I saw him walk away, and he went in the
direction of the east, which wasn’t toward the river at all. I don’t
know how it came I seemed to take it for granted Perk was going fishing;
must have had something on my mind at the time, and didn’t notice that
he hadn’t his rod along. What makes things worse is that storm!”</p>
<p>“Storm!” echoed Amos, staring around; “why, it’s as blue as indigo
overhead right now; where’s your storm, Wee Willie?”</p>
<p>“We seem to feel one coming in our bones,” explained the other.
“Sometimes, you know you can tell that one’s due by certain signs. And
if you look sharp you’ll see clouds gathering over in the southwest;
which is the quarter most of our big summer storms spring from.”</p>
<p>Amos did look, and then shook his head as if dismayed at the prospect.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for Perk, that’s all,” he remarked.</p>
<p>“Oh there isn’t so much chance of anything serious overtaking him,”
Elmer hastily assured him. “To be sure he’s likely to get well drenched,
and perhaps the thunder and lightning, as well as falling trees around
him, may make it unpleasant for Perk; but that’s really the extent of
it. If he wanders far he’s apt to get out of the timber belt, and run on
some farm-house where he could get shelter, food and ditto a bed.”</p>
<p>“Yes, no one could ever refuse him anything he asked for, what with that
winning smile of his,” said Amos.</p>
<p>They continued shouting at more frequent intervals, until all of them
began to get quite hoarse; but there was no perceptible result. The
second half hour thus began to draw toward a close.</p>
<p>“All useless, seems like!” admitted Wee Willie in disgust.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Elmer observed, “we’re wasting time doing this, when we’d have
shown better judgment in starting out a while ago. Knowing Perk’s
failing as we do, we ought to have made up our minds that sooner or
later we’d have to go out after him.”</p>
<p>He had seen to it that the single lantern they carried with them to the
woods was well filled with oil from the extra bottle.</p>
<p>“Who’s going along?” Wee Willie now asked.</p>
<p>“I thought at first two of us would be enough,” said Elmer, “but changed
my mind, and so we’ll go in a bunch”; at which information Amos looked
pleased, for he had feared they would figure him out of the game.</p>
<p>“I’ll fix my camera so it can’t possibly get wet, if the storm comes,
and the old roof drips in spite of all our fixing,” he hurriedly called
out, darting inside the cabin.</p>
<p>“Not afraid about leaving our things unguarded, are you?” asked Wee
Willie. “It would be a joke on us if that lunatic happened around, and
cleaned us out of everything.”</p>
<p>“We’ll have to take chances on that,” Elmer decided, “but I reckon there
isn’t much danger. We can close the door, and wedge it fast, so that any
one’d believe it was barred inside, and that some of us were at home.”</p>
<p>“You said it, Elmer,” chuckled the other, “takes you to think up clever
little schemes right along. I suppose we can expect to get a good
ducking before we’re through this job.”</p>
<p>“Oh! well, we’re not made of sugar or salt, Wee Willie; and we’d stand
much more than that for Perk!”</p>
<p>“I should think we would!” quickly declared the tall chum,
energetically, as though anxious to put himself on record. “Why, I’d go
through fire and water for him, and think little of it. I’m only
worrying for fear something might happen to Perk, something serious you
know.”</p>
<p>“Yes, such as a tree falling on him in the storm,” Elmer added, “or his
breaking a leg by tripping over a trailing vine as he ran headlong,
trying to find some sort of shelter. But let’s hope nothing like that
will happen.”</p>
<p>“I’ve put a cake of chocolate in my pocket, Elmer, in case we don’t get
back to camp to-night, and feel hungry; you fellows had better do the
same. Wonderful lot of nourishment in chocolate you know. Think I’ll get
another, for Perk, when we find him.”</p>
<p>“Now that’s a good idea,” agreed Elmer, “and I’ll see that Amos follows
suit.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t want him to stay alone here while we were gone, I noticed,
Elmer. What was the big idea?”</p>
<p>“In the first place, three might be better in scouring the woods than
two. Then again I was afraid Amos would feel it terribly if left all
alone in a storm, and as nervous as he is just now, worrying over his
father. He was pleased when he heard me say all of us were to go.”</p>
<p>“Of course, we ought to try to follow up Perk’s trail as long as it’s
light enough, eh, Elmer?”</p>
<p>“I expect to, and even afterwards by the help of our lantern, Wee
Willie. If he’s kept turning to the left, as I suppose will be the case,
and we continued along due east, we’d soon be leaving him further and
further away. As it is we can cover several miles before we’re forced to
quit, and a burst of shouts might reach him.”</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XV</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>CAUGHT IN THE STORM</span>
</h2>
</div>
<p>So plain was the trail of the wanderer that they had no trouble in
following it at quite a rapid pace. Indeed, Elmer calculated that they
were proceeding even faster than Perk himself had gone along; for as a
rule the stout chum was not prone to make speed except when
circumstances demanded that he let himself out—in a baseball game; or it
might be a sack race for a prize.</p>
<p>More than once did Elmer mentally take himself to task for not starting
out much sooner. The afternoon was closing in, and it would not be a
great while before night came on. Even another precious half hour of
daylight might have proven of considerable value to them; but then Elmer
knew it was useless now to indulge in vain regrets.</p>
<p>By the time it began to get so dusky that even his keen eyes had
difficulty in making out the trail, he decided it was necessary to make
use of the lantern.</p>
<p>They had come quite a distance, Wee Willie figuring it out as possibly a
couple of miles, which must have been a conservative guess, Elmer
agreed. So he struck a match, and presently when the trail was taken up
again the lantern light allowed them to see Perk’s heavy tracks plainly.</p>
<p>Already they had changed their course considerably. Perk aimed to avoid
pushing through many of the thickets, and rough places he encountered;
which had a tendency to throw him now to the right, and again to the
left, until naturally he became bewildered, and doubtless for the life
of him could not decide in which quarter the cabin lay.</p>
<p>From the indications Wee Willie judged that he had stopped to cast a
stone into numerous thickets, in expectation of starting a partridge
out, which he hoped would betray that queer trick the other boys had
been speaking about. When after much wandering, and repeated failures to
score, Perk finally made up his mind that it was time for him to turn
his face toward camp, he must have been thoroughly disgusted to discover
that he did not have the slightest idea as to whether the cabin lay on
the right, the left, before, or behind him; and that he was really and
truly lost.</p>
<p>But then that did not have any great terror for Perk. He had been lost
so many times before that it was getting to be an old story. Doubtless
he would keep on trying to “find himself” until he realized the
hopelessness of it all, when he would philosophically sit down, to make
a fire, and toast his shins, until such time as his mates came along
with a rescue party; for he knew they could easily follow his tracks.</p>
<p>Perk, however, did not take certain possibilities into consideration, if
he figured it out that way, for one thing the coming of the storm. At no
other time when he played the part of the “babes in the woods” had
anything like that overtaken him; and if there was one particular type
of Nature’s moods which Perk disliked most cordially it was a storm.</p>
<p>The lightning always made him jump; the thunder awed him; while the roar
of a violent wind through the trees, sounding like a runaway railway
train coming down the slope, made his flesh fairly creep. So that it can
be seen an experience he would not soon forget faced the reckless woods
wanderer on this occasion.</p>
<p>They had not been moving again very long after the lantern was lighted
when Wee Willie called their attention to the moaning of the wind
through the tops of the tall trees.</p>
<p>“That always means storm, according to my weather education,” he
affirmed; “anyhow, I never yet knew it to fail. The clouds are working
up all the time, too, boys. Guess we’ll be swimming before a great
while. Worst of all is the fact that once the water comes down, good-by
to our tracking, for even Perk’s heavy trail would soon be washed clean
out.”</p>
<p>“And not a single little woods varmint have we run across,” suggested
Elmer, who never failed to notice everything, “which shows that their
instinct tells them there’s something afoot, and that they’d better hug
their underground holes, or hollow trees, for shelter.”</p>
<p>“How weird that wind does sound through the treetops,” said Amos,
shuddering as he spoke. “You could almost imagine it came from some
unseen spirits, or that the trees were gossiping, just like a pack of
old women over their teacups.”</p>
<p>Wee Willie had not thought of that, because he was a practical sort of
fellow; but then Amos happened to be built along different lines, being
given a lively imagination.</p>
<p>“Here’s where Perk commenced to hurry some,” observed Elmer at that
juncture. “He must have begun to realize he didn’t seem to be striking
the river very fast, for he even ran a short distance, lumbering along
like an ice-wagon, and falling more than a few times.”</p>
<p>“Huh! getting some anxious, I warrant you,” grunted Wee Willie. “Began
to be afraid he’d miss his supper if he didn’t do better.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say that,” urged Elmer, reprovingly; “I’d rather believe Perk was
thinking of the worry he might cause the rest of his chums.”</p>
<p>“Say,” snapped the other as quick as a flash, “forget what I said,
please, fellows; it came from the lips, but not from the heart. I didn’t
mean it, that’s right. Perk isn’t the chap to think of himself first;
there never was a more loyal comrade, or one who wanted more to be of
service to his pals.”</p>
<p>That was Wee Willie all over—too ready to say things of which he
immediately repented, when he would strive to make amends. But Elmer
liked him all the better on account of his quick temper, and habit of
speaking without considering the result; Wee Willie had his faults, but
to Elmer’s mind he was an angel compared with some sly fellows who
seemed to have a perpetual sneer in their tones, and a curl to their
upper lips.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t that distant thunder I heard then?” asked Amos.</p>
<p>“Just what it was,” Elmer admitted; “so we didn’t hit far out of the way
when we decided we were in for a storm.”</p>
<p>“But it’s a long way off yet,” urged the other.</p>
<p>“That’s true, but when the wind starts to blow it doesn’t take long for
a gale to strike home,” the boy with the lighted lantern reminded him.</p>
<p>“About how long would you give us before it arrives?” continued Amos.</p>
<p>“Anywhere from ten minutes to half an hour,” he was told. “Sometimes
they take a notion to swing around, and attack from a new quarter; which
holds things up more or less.”</p>
<p>“Huh! you never can tell what a crazy old storm will do,” grunted Wee
Willie. “I’ve had ’em die down on me, but just when I was taking a good
breath, slam bang! and the game was on again, the second edition being a
heap worse than the original dose. It pays to keep right on the job when
there’s a twister working your patch of the woods.”</p>
<p>“It pays to keep on the alert, no matter where you are. Preparedness has
won many a battle on the field, in business, and with private affairs.
The fellow who is ready has three chances to one for the shiftless chap
caught off his guard.”</p>
<p>It was not long before the distant boom of the thunder grew perceptibly
louder, proving that the storm was advancing their way, and could not be
much longer delayed in transit.</p>
<p>“We might holler a few times,” suggested Wee Willie, “and if by great
good luck Perk is close enough to hear us, so much the better.”</p>
<p>“Go to it, then,” advised Elmer, knowing Wee Willie had a voice that
would be apt to carry much further than his own, or that of Amos.</p>
<p>Without waiting for a second invitation the elongated chum threw back
his head and sent forth one of his shrillest yells.</p>
<p>“Perk! oh! Perk! Hey! there!” he bawled.</p>
<p>“Perk! hey there!” came a startling mocking answer that caused Wee
Willie to jump, and stare hard at Elmer.</p>
<p>“W-why, did y-you hear that?” he gasped.</p>
<p>“Only an echo,” the other told him. “It repeated your words after you.
As a rule it requires some sort of elevation to create an echo; but
they’ve been known to spring right up from what looked like level
ground. A lot depends on the condition of the atmosphere. I’ve known of
a mighty fine echo that would send back a double line at you like fun,
and yet it came out of a marsh. I admit echoes have always been
something of a puzzle to me; but that was one just now, all right.”</p>
<p>“A queer thing,” Amos hurried to say, “and at first I really thought it
was Perk hiding close by, and mocking Wee Willie here. Can you still
follow his tracks, Elmer?”</p>
<p>“It’s as easy as falling off a log,” replied the one addressed, “but for
a fact I’m more than surprised at Perk keeping it up so long. He must
have been provoked with himself over getting lost, and determined to
make the punishment fit the crime. Why, we’ve come more than three
miles, up to now.”</p>
<p>“If we’re going to find him before that storm breaks, it’s got to be
done fast now,” Wee Willie told them, when a still more resonant grumble
followed what was plainly a distant flash of lightning.</p>
<p>“All we can do,” advised the guide with the lighted lantern, “is to keep
moving until we’re up against it, when of course we’ll have to try to
find some shelter ourselves.”</p>
<p>Wee Willie continued to let out a whoop from time to time. It amused
him, at least, and could do no harm, while there was always a slender
chance that Perk might hear and reply.</p>
<p>“Wow! things are getting pretty warm!” he announced shortly afterwards,
when a really deafening crash followed quickly on the heels of a
blinding electric display.</p>
<p>“I felt the first drop of rain on my face when I looked up at that
flash,” said Amos, trying to show the utmost coolness.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s going to break right away,” said Elmer.</p>
<p>“Perk, I wonder where you are?” Wee Willie remarked on a hazard,
remembering what a dislike the lost chum invariably displayed toward all
kinds of strife among the elements.</p>
<p>“Listen! what’s that?” asked Amos. “Sounds for all the world like a
regular young Niagara going over the falls.”</p>
<p>“It means the rain is rushing down on us, and that we’re going to be
soaked through and through in a jiffy,” Elmer told him.</p>
<p>Five minutes afterwards and they found themselves in the midst of as
lively a summer gale as any of them had ever known, with the artillery
in the heavens keeping up an almost constant booming, occupied by
dazzling flashes of lightning; while to the right and to the left they
could hear terrific crashing sounds as trees were laid prostrate before
the fury of the hurricane wind!</p>

</h2>
</div>
<p>Progress of course was utterly out of the question while all this racket
continued. Indeed, even with the aid of the lantern, and the almost
incessant flashing of the lightning, they could never have found the
marks left by Perk in his erratic wanderings; for already had the
downpour of rain washed them completely out of existence as though the
trail had never been.</p>
<p>“No telling how long this is going to last, of course?” called out Amos,
and his voice quivered more or less, despite his brave efforts to appear
quite unconcerned, as a veteran of camp and trail should.</p>
<p>“It may soon be over,” replied Elmer, “and again there’s always a chance
of such a storm holding out all night.”</p>
<p>“Wonder if we couldn’t find some sort of shelter?” ventured Wee Willie,
doubtless voicing the thought that was in each of his companions’ minds.</p>
<p>“Let’s bear off in this direction,” suggested Elmer, turning toward the
right, and as he carried the lantern the others were compelled to follow
him.</p>
<p>“But the trees seem to be getting smaller over here, Elmer,” protested
the tall chum.</p>
<p>“Sure thing, I know that,” called the guide over his shoulder, “but
we’re not looking for any big hollow oak, with all this lightning
around, you know. Notice that the ground’s getting rocky, and that it
begins to lie in queer ledges? I’ve seen just such places before, and
I’m hoping we’ll run across a ledge that’ll hang out far enough to let
us crawl underneath.”</p>
<p>“Wow! that’s the stuff!” admitted Wee Willie, apparently giving in to
the judgment of his leader without any dispute.</p>
<p>“Something up ahead there that looks like it might pan out,” called Amos
just then; though he could not feel sure he saw correctly, because of
the water that ran down his face, and seemed at times to act as a sort
of curtain hiding out the wretched picture.</p>
<p>“We’re in great luck!” cried Elmer, ten seconds later, “for here’s just
the sort of ledge I had in mind, with plenty of room for all of us to
creep under the outcropping shelf of rock.”</p>
<p>Down on hands and knees they went. This was no time for being
particular, when the situation was so desperate; a little dirt did not
matter, for who does not know how the average boy manages to keep on
good terms with grime, without letting its presence interfere at all
with his appetite, or enjoyment.</p>
<p>“Whirr! whirr!”</p>
<p>“Hey! what’s all this?” bellowed Wee Willie, already screwed up in a
knot, as he doubled his long legs in the endeavor to push further under
the friendly shelf of rock, one of Nature’s freaks in that neck of the
tall timber, but wonderfully acceptable to those caught in the wild
storm.</p>
<p>“Only a covey of partridges we’ve scared out of their hiding-place,”
Elmer instantly called back. “They thought they owned it, but we’ve put
in a quit claim. All under, boys?”</p>
<p>“Say, this isn’t half so bad!” Amos exclaimed.</p>
<p>“It’s all right,” ventured Wee Willie, “if only we don’t get drowned in
the water that’s going to ooze from our clothes. I reckon I weigh close
on a ton right now; why, I could hardly lift my leg toward the last, I
carried such a cargo of soaked stuff with me.”</p>
<p>They lay there panting for a while, “resting up,” as a boy would put it.</p>
<p>“Any port in a storm, the sailor says,” Elmer presently sang out, “and
this time we can understand what that homely old phrase means.”</p>
<p>“Getting some chilly though, don’t you think?” said Amos, his teeth
chattering as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Oh! that’s because we’re wet to the bone,” the tall chum asserted.
“Since we can’t help ourselves we’ve just got to grin and bear it. Lots
of fellows may be a heap worse off than we are right now.”</p>
<p>He was thinking of Perk, of course; but Amos had another person in mind
when, during a brief lull in the roaring of the storm he was heard to
groan, and say half to himself:</p>
<p>“I wonder where he can be; and if he’s out in all this terrible storm,
poor old dad!”</p>
<p>Wee Willie might have reassured him had he chosen. He could have told
Amos that those who have descended to the low level of becoming plain
ordinary hoboes, tramping the highways, and counting the railroad ties
in their peregrinations to and fro over the country, are as a rule, able
to foresee the coming of bad weather, and generally manage to find some
shelter in advance.</p>
<p>However, he did not say this, because to do so would hurt the feelings
of Amos; who seemed still to have considerable love for the father he
had not seen nor heard from for several long years.</p>
<p>How the minutes dragged!</p>
<p>Wee Willie, too, had now begun to shiver, though he would not have
admitted that he was cold had he been accused of such a thing. While the
rain did not gain admittance to the space under the overlapping ledge of
rock, the wind could not be kept entirely out; and owing to their being
so wet this caused them much inconvenience, to say the least.</p>
<p>“Don’t you believe it’s letting up some, Elmer?” pleaded Amos, after a
bit.</p>
<p>“I was just thinking so myself when you spoke,” came the reply. “Yes,
the rain, you see, has almost stopped, though the wind keeps up a great
roaring in the treetops. But it’s lost some of its fury to boot; I
haven’t heard a tree crash down for some time.”</p>
<p>“Huh! guess all the weak brothers have been knocked silly by now!”
grunted Wee Willie, using this method of speaking because he could
disguise the fact that his teeth were rattling like the castanets he had
once seen a Spanish dancer use at a concert.</p>
<p>“Make up your mind, the performance is over for to-night,” Elmer
thrilled them by declaring five minutes afterwards.</p>
<p>“Well, for goodness’ sake, don’t let’s do anything to coax an encore,”
begged Amos. “But I can hear the rain coming down still, Elmer.”</p>
<p>“I reckon now that’s just the water dripping from the trees you hear,”
he was assured, which turned out to be the case.</p>
<p>They hugged their confined quarters for a short time longer; then Elmer
made a move as though meaning to crawl out.</p>
<p>“Come along, boys!” he called; “we’ll feel a heap better to get on our
feet, and start the blood to circulating again.”</p>
<p>“You said it, Elmer,” honestly confessed Amos; “why, I’m shaking like I
had the ague right now. And I’m not sure but that Wee Willie’s going to
fall to pieces soon if he keeps on the way he does, he’s so loosely made
up, you know.”</p>
<p>“Oh! I guess not <i>yet</i> awhile,” snapped the one referred to, who however
lost no time in creeping out from under the ledge where the wise
partridges had taken up their quarters for the night, anticipating a wet
time.</p>
<p>No sooner was Elmer on his feet than laying the lantern aside he
commenced slapping both arms violently about him, at the same time
jumping up and down after the manner of a savage indulging in a dance.</p>
<p>“The only way to get your blood to circulating!” Wee Willie admitted, as
he hastened to imitate the others example; and presently there were
three dancers hopping about, and making wild gesticulations with their
waving arms.</p>
<p>All of them began to feel considerably better, though their breath was
soon coming in short pants.</p>
<p>“This is an improvement,” Elmer called out, “but we ought to have a
fire!”</p>
<p>“Fire!”</p>
<p>That word always appealed to Wee Willie, even as a red rag does to an
aggressive bull; he never needed more than half a hint to find an excuse
for building one.</p>
<p>“Whoop! watch my smoke, fellows!” he cried, delightedly. “I’m some boy
when you need a blaze. Don’t either of you dare to offer to help;
because I’m the fire-maker of this circus!”</p>
<p>One thing that the tall chum always insisted on when in the woods was to
carry his pet camp hatchet along with him wherever he went. Many times
it was likely to prove a grievous burden, but should the occasion arise
when its value could be fully appreciated, like the present, Wee Willie
felt amply rewarded for his forethought.</p>
<p>He had it loose and ready before Amos could have said “Jack Robinson,”
and picking out an old stump near by attacked it with great vigor, Elmer
holding his lantern so that the chopper could see what he was doing.</p>
<p>Of course the fire-maker was after the dry heart of the stump, which
could not have been soaked by the recent downpour. Soon he was
collecting small splinters of this inflammable wood, until he had quite
a decent pile laid by. At the base he inserted the finest and most
tempting of fibers, to which he meant to apply a match presently; since
this was certainly no time for him to show off his knowledge of
wonderful though tedious ways for making a fire without the aid of
common, every-day matches.</p>
<p>It matters little to one who had made a hobby of the subject, that
everything around may be reeking with water; because he knows a variety
of ways for producing the desired result. Many fellows less wise would
have tried in vain, and used up their whole stock of matches in
endeavoring to coax wet tinder to burn.</p>
<p>Amos gave an exclamation indicative of solid satisfaction when in
response to the click of the match, carefully protected by Wee Willie’s
hat, a tiny blaze sprang up that rapidly increased in volume.</p>
<p>“Hurrah for you, Wee Willie! You’re surely the champion fire-builder of
the universe. You’ll set the world on fire some of these days, if they
don’t watch you pretty close. My but that feels fine already!”</p>
<p>“Oh! but I’ve got to have heavier stuff to put on top, or it’ll peter
out on us,” objected the other, bustling about.</p>
<p>He must have figured on just where he could lay hold of the necessary
supplies, for almost in a jiffy he started piling dead branches over the
leaping blaze, which, rapidly drying out began in turn to take fire,
until there was a delightful roaring pyramid of flames leaping cheerily
upward, and sending out such glorious heat that the boys had to move
back a foot at a time.</p>
<p>Their clothes also began to send out clouds of steam as the genial
warmth commenced the drying process. Everybody showed signs of feeling a
thousand per cent more comfortable; and there was no longer any
necessity for their performing those wild antics, like warriors before
the hunt or battle.</p>

</h2>
</div>
<p>“Why, I guess I’m all dry again,” Amos later on remarked with a degree
of satisfaction in his words. “That heat certainly works fine. After
all, it wasn’t such a terribly hard experience.”</p>
<p>Amos was like most other people who are prone to forget how they have
suffered, once the sun of prosperity shines again; but then it is
fortunate boys are so constituted that they can “put their troubles in
their old kit-bag,” and be merry once more.</p>
<p>“Of course,” observed Wee Willie, “we can’t do a thing now till morning;
even then our only job will be to keep on the move, and letting out an
occasional whoop in hopes of reaching Perk. I’d sure give something to
know what that same Perk is doing right now.”</p>
<p>“Elmer, what’s that moving out there?” gasped Amos, as though something
suddenly ice-cold gripped his heart.</p>
<p>“Why, it seems to be a <i>man</i>, and he’s heading this way, too!” exclaimed
the tall chum. “Say, wouldn’t it be a queer stunt now if this happened
to be our—well, the party we scared out of the cabin at the Bend?”</p>
<p>Amos uttered a plaintive little cry, but hastily followed it by saying:</p>
<p>“No, it can’t be, because you see he doesn’t limp at all!”</p>
<p>The man continued to come straight toward them, though Elmer rather
suspected that he was eyeing them closely as he advanced, possibly
wondering who and what they were. At least he was no tramp, his
appearance indicating more or less refinement; though to be sure he was
fairly dripping just then, as though he had borne the full force of the
downpour.</p>
<p>“Good evening, boys!” he called out as he drew near. “That fire
certainly looks tempting; and if you’ve no objections I’d like to warm
up a bit. Beastly storm, wasn’t it? I seem to be pretty damp; but it
doesn’t matter; nothing really does when you make your mind up not to
worry.”</p>
<p>He held his hands out to the blaze as he finished. Elmer stared at him
in a puzzled way. To meet such a light-hearted man after the passage of
so dreadful a storm, and away up there in the woods, too, was rather
bewildering.</p>
<p>“I suppose you’re all wondering who your unexpected guest will turn out
to be, boys,” suddenly said the man, turning and surveying them keenly.
“Allow me to introduce myself then as Doctor Frank Hitchens, connected
with the State Institute for the Insane. I lost my connection with a
party out searching this region for a clever inmate who managed to break
away recently. At first I imagined you were my companions in the hunt;
but as I drew closer I realized my mistake.”</p>
<p>“Oh! is that so, sir?” exclaimed Wee Willie, impulsively. “Why, we
happened to meet your two friends recently. They came knocking at the
door of our cabin, and at first thought they’d cornered their man. When
they found we were only a party of boys from Chester, camping out, they
asked a lot of questions; but we couldn’t give them any clue, of course.
So you’re the doctor from the Asylum, are you, sir? If you come over on
this side of the fire you can dry off without so much of the smoke
striking you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, son, I’ll do so,” the newcomer replied, suiting action to
word.</p>
<p>He seemed to like to talk, as though the sound of his voice might be
pleasant to his own ears. Elmer held back and listened, hoping to grasp
the situation better by observing the expressions that flitted in
succession across the face of Dr. Hitchens.</p>
<p>In the first place, he concluded that the other must be unusually smart,
for he seemed to be well posted on every kind of subject. As he spoke,
Elmer saw frowns, and then shrewd looks flit across his face; from which
he also concluded that the medical man must be the possessor of
something of a temper; he really looked like one whom it would be unwise
to irritate.</p>
<p>Wee Willie apparently was quite taken with the doctor. He asked various
questions, and supplied all the information he had at his command, when
the other wished to know this or that.</p>
<p>“Didn’t Collins or Andrews chance to mention my name to you, when they
made their call last night; or happen to say they had missed connections
with Dr. Frank Hitchens?” he finally inquired, cunningly, Elmer thought.</p>
<p>Wee Willie shook his head in the negative.</p>
<p>“Why, no, sir, not a word did those guards say about having any one else
along,” he hastened to explain. “They had a dog with them, a sort of
hound, I reckon, because he had long ears, and bayed like one; but
somehow they didn’t seem to get a whiff of the scent of the escaped
lunatic.”</p>
<p>Wee Willie was wise enough not to say anything concerning the fact that
they had frightened some one away from the cabin on first arriving.
Since they were now of the opinion that party had been Mr. Codling,
Amos’s long-missing parent, it was only fair to that comrade nothing be
said about his presence near by.</p>
<p>“By the way,” continued the doctor, with glittering eyes, “did the
guards happen to mention the name of the—er, runaway?” and Elmer thought
he caught a slight chuckle when that last word was forcibly pronounced.</p>
<p>“Why, yes, they told us his name was, let me see, Felix Something or
other—oh! yes, Felix Gould; and that he was a mighty clever chap—used to
be an actor in his palmy days, too, and just wonderfully smart.”</p>
<p>“He is all of that,” commented the other, with a faint smile on his
face. “In fact, I don’t believe I ever ran across a more engaging chap
in all my wide experience than this same Felix Gould. The world had not
treated his genius right, which was the main cause for all his mental
troubles. But then they say everything comes to him who waits; and there
are times when even walls do not a prison make. Life still has
compensations for all the ills flesh is heir to.”</p>
<p>His manner was really quite dramatic when saying this, Elmer noticed. As
for Wee Willie, somehow he seemed to have fallen under the spell of the
other’s masterful manner, for he sat there, and listened as though
entranced, hardly able to take his eyes off the doctor’s mobile face.</p>
<p>And then with the abruptness shown by a bolt of lightning coming from
what had been considered a clear sky, a thought suddenly sped through
Elmer’s brain. It dazzled him, too, at first by its brilliance, yes, and
thrilled him at the same time on account of the element of danger that
accompanied the revelation.</p>
<p>Once this idea seized hold of him, Elmer watched the face of Dr.
Hitchens more closely than ever. He was trying to read the secret of
those rapidly working features, those glittering eyes, and the strange
smile that every now and then crept into view, as though the physician
might be taking infinite satisfaction in having found such a ready
convert to his views in Wee Willie, whom he had apparently well-nigh
hypnotized.</p>
<p>Amos chancing to turn his gaze toward Elmer saw the other make a quick
little movement with his head. It said “come here” as plainly as words
could have done, an invitation Amos hastened to accept.</p>
<p>At the same time somehow or other he displayed considerable caution
concerning his movements, though unaware just why he should do so. A
minute afterwards and he dropped down alongside the other chum, who was
so far as appearances went only interested in brushing off the lower
extremities of his wrinkled trousers.</p>
<p>“What do you think of him, Elmer; a queer sort of a chap, that doctor
is, it strikes me?” remarked Amos, in what he meant to be a low voice.</p>
<p>“Be careful how you speak, Amos,” came in guarded tones. “I’ve been
sizing him up and I don’t like his looks. In fact, I think he is no
other than Felix Gould himself!”</p>
<p>“Oh! my stars! the escaped actor lunatic!” whispered Amos, plainly
aghast at hearing this startling announcement.</p>

</h2>
</div>
<p>For a full minute nothing further passed between the two chums. Amos was
slyly observing the newcomer, who continued to talk most eloquently,
rattling along on some subject or other, and holding Wee Willie
spellbound.</p>
<p>“Elmer!” finally whispered Amos.</p>
<p>“Yes,” came from the other, though Elmer did not desist from his
occupation of making his trousers legs look more presentable, just as if
it mattered in the slightest degree how creased or muddy they might be,
off in the woods as they were, where no critical eye could ever detect
the faults.</p>
<p>“I—guess—you’re right about that!” wheezed Amos.</p>
<p>“I’m getting more and more certain with every minute,” asserted the
other. “I can see it in his shifty eyes, and his every action. Why, he’s
as mad as anything, and has been playing a clever little trick on us.
You must know these people who are out of their senses just love to
imitate other folks, and make believe they’re Napoleon Bonaparte,
General Grant, or some noted character in history. He chances to have a
fancy for being the doctor at the asylum; perhaps he’s studied his ways,
and can take the other off to the life. But we’re stacked up against a
bunch of trouble, believe me, with <i>him</i> in camp.”</p>
<p>“He’d be a dangerous man to tackle, I expect?” ventured Amos, dubiously.</p>
<p>“They always are hard to handle, I’ve heard,” Elmer told him. “Why, even
a weak looking woman, if out of her mind, and violent, will be all four
men can manage; and at that she’ll claw their faces something dreadful.”</p>
<p>“Whew! but we ought to get rid of him, some way or other,” continued
Amos. “I wish I knew of a scheme to start: Elmer, how about you?”</p>
<p>Elmer did not reply immediately. He happened to notice that the furtive
eyes of the man under suspicion chanced to be resting on them just then;
and it was far from his wish to cause the other to suspect they knew his
real identity.</p>
<p>Possibly Wee Willie asked some question just naturally, as he was deeply
engrossed in certain things the “doctor” had been telling him; at any
rate those searching eyes were again removed from the vicinity of the
spot where Elmer and Amos sat close together.</p>
<p>“As force is out of the question,” said Elmer, softly, “why the only
thing left is strategy.”</p>
<p>“Yes—go on, please, for I just <i>know</i> you’ve got a scheme made up,”
breathed Amos.</p>
<p>“Don’t look so hungrily at me while I’m talking, Amos,” he was told.
“Try and grin, as if what I say might be funny. That man’s eyes are like
those of a rat or a ferret, and can look right through you.”</p>
<p>It may have been but a wretched excuse for a laugh that Amos managed to
emit; but at any rate such a sound would make it appear as though he
were listening to some humorous observation on the part of his mate.
Elmer, appeased by this, continued to “lift the lid,” as Wee Willie
would term it, and explain what he had in mind.</p>
<p>“We’ll manage to break into the talk after a bit, understand, Amos,” he
was now saying, “and don’t be surprised when I make a statement that
isn’t exactly true. But those two guards <i>did</i> say they hoped to run
across us again while up here in this neck of the woods; you heard them,
Amos?”</p>
<p>“I certainly did,” came the quick reply.</p>
<p>“All right then, a fellow is allowed to stretch things just a little
when the circumstances are as desperate as they seem to be with us right
now. Well, I’m meaning to remark incidentally that we kind of expect
them to drop in on us before morning; in fact, that they may see the
light of our campfire any old time, and show up. Get that, Amos?”</p>
<p>The other actually chuckled, this time without much of an effort.</p>
<p>“I’m on to your game, Elmer,” he announced, eagerly.</p>
<p>“Do you think it’s a good one?” demanded the originator of the scheme.</p>
<p>“Simply great, and that’s a fact. Of course, if he was the genuine
article he’d act as if delighted to know there was a chance for him to
meet up with the balance of the search posse again.”</p>
<p>“Oh! don’t fool yourself about that, Amos; he’s too smart not to act as
if tickled half to death at the prospect,” resumed Elmer. “I expect all
that to happen.”</p>
<p>“Then how are we going to know whether he’s the real, or counterfeit
article, Elmer?”</p>
<p>“They say the proof of the pudding is in the eating of it, Amos. Lots of
things in this world are different from what they seem to be on their
face. No matter what his make-believe is, we’ll know the truth by his
actions, when he thinks no one is looking.”</p>
<p>“You mean he’s likely to skip out before morning, eh, Elmer?”</p>
<p>“There’s a big chance that way, I reckon.”</p>
<p>“Oh! I hope so, I certainly do,” said Amos. “I never did like to run
across any one who was out of his mind; they always made me feel queer.
But I’ve just thought of something, Elmer, that might queer your fine
game.”</p>
<p>“Is it—Wee Willie?” asked the other, quickly.</p>
<p>“How on earth did you guess so easily, I’d like to know?” gasped Amos,
quite taken aback for the moment.</p>
<p>“Just because I had thought about him myself,” came the answer. “He’s
sitting there, and drinking in everything that chap tells him as if he
might be in a daze. Yes, I wondered how he would take it when he heard
me say I expected those two guards to join us any old time now.”</p>
<p>“Gee! Wee Willie might blurt out something that would make him suspect
you only said that so as to alarm him!”</p>
<p>“There’s only one way to prevent that,” his comrade told him. “I’ll be
sure to catch his eye just before I say anything, and give him the high
sign. Wee Willie knows what that’ll mean; he’ll understand that he’s got
to keep his lips tightly buttoned up,—just sit there and listen. You’ll
see how lucky it is we had all those signals arranged long ago.”</p>
<p>“That was your doing, Elmer; why, if you’d looked ahead, and seen just
such an occasion as this, you couldn’t have fixed things better. But
won’t Wee Willie be eating himself up with curiosity, though? He’ll
wonder what under the sun it all means.”</p>
<p>“I expect to find a chance to tell him what’s in the wind, Amos; in fact
it’s more than likely he’ll make such an opening himself, so as to be in
the swim with us.”</p>
<p>“There, he’s watching us again, Elmer; just as if he suspected we might
be talking about him by ourselves off here.”</p>
<p>Elmer laughed, and went on to act as if detailing some choice bit of
gossip concerning one of their home pals in Chester. Amos, stirred to
action by the necessities of the case, also managed to look as if
tickled over something, although merriment came hard with a fellow who
for years now had been carrying such a load of anxiety and boyish sorrow
on his shoulders, all connected with the episode of his father’s
vanishing, and the constant sad face of his mother.</p>
<p>Elmer did not believe in hurrying things. He knew that many a promising
plan of campaign has been ruined simply through an application of too
much haste. The night was long; indeed, it would likely seem
interminable to the three lads who found themselves face to face with
such an unpleasant experience. So he would wait patiently; possibly luck
might favor them, and the unwelcome visitor announce his intention of
leaving, a happening that would make the carrying out of his cleverly
arranged plan unnecessary.</p>
<p>The minutes dragged past.</p>
<p>“I saw him yawn right then, Elmer; he’s getting sleepy, I should say;
which looks like he meant to stick by us to-night,” Amos whispered,
after another quarter of an hour had crept by.</p>
<p>The talkative “doctor” must have tired himself out, or else his mood
changed, for he had about quit speaking to Wee Willie. In fact, the
latter was also beginning to display unmistakable signs of being ready
to turn in, the heat of the crackling fire doubtless causing his eyes to
grow heavy.</p>
<p>Elmer decided that the time was at hand for him to do something. Once
their unwelcome guest lay down and went to sleep it would be too late.</p>
<p>First of all, he was watching to get the eye of the tall chum. Wee
Willie on his part was suddenly surprised, and electrified as well, to
see Elmer make a little movement with his hand which he easily
understood to mean: “Don’t open your mouth to say a thing when you hear
me make a statement; you’ll know all about it later on!”</p>
<p>Elmer repeated it so as to make sure the other understood, and when he
saw Wee Willie make a similar movement he felt that matters were
settled.</p>
<p>With that Elmer called out to the visitor:</p>
<p>“Of course you mean to bunk with us to-night, Doctor? Sorry we haven’t
anything to offer you in the way of food, but we came away from our camp
in a big hurry, anxious about our missing chum, and failed to fetch grub
along. But after the storm, with the woods all soaked with water, I
guess a fire feels too good to leave; how about that, Doctor?”</p>
<p>Elmer wisely made out to use that designation whenever possible; he
fancied it might please the other, and allay any suspicion he might have
been entertaining toward the speaker. Those wonderfully keen eyes seemed
almost to pierce Elmer, as the other surveyed him closely.</p>
<p>“Thank you, that’s very kind,” he remarked, smoothly; “and I think I
shall accept the invitation in the same spirit it is given. Yes, this
fire does warm one up, after such a soaking; and it would be foolish for
me to leave such good company.”</p>
<p>“There’s another reason why you ought to stay with us, Doctor,”
continued Elmer, looking so innocent that Amos made up his mind the
other was built for a clever actor.</p>
<p>“Indeed, what might that be, I’d like to know?” said the other, with a
vein of sudden alarm in his voice.</p>
<p>“Why, the chances are we’ll be joined by two good friends of yours
between now and sunrise,” continued the boy. “I mean Collins and
Andrews, those fine fellows you brought with you from the asylum, when
you came in search of that cunning Felix Gould!”</p>
<p>The man was silent for a full minute. He seemed to be pondering over
something, for he frowned, and then forced himself to look pleasant.</p>
<p>“That is rare good news you are giving me, my young friend!” he burst
out, though had he chanced just then to have turned his head and looked
at Wee Willie, to note the expression of blank bewilderment to be seen
on his freckled face, he might have felt less confidence. “What makes
you think there will be a reunion of forces to-night? Collins and
Andrews are great cronies of mine, whom I shall, of course, be delighted
to meet again.”</p>
<p>“Why, they said they meant to put in the day searching the woods up
here; and something seems to tell me they’ll surely drop in.”</p>
<p>“It is very kind of you to tell me such delightful news,” the other
replied. “Yes, I’ll cuddle down here by your fire, and snatch a little
sleep, of which I am in great need; though food is something I’d like to
see before me as well.”</p>
<p>They all lay down as if to sleep, but it was a very alert group indeed,
stretched out there, including the “doctor.”</p>

</div>
<p>“What does it all mean, Elmer?”</p>
<p>Wee Willie whispered this as he managed to roll over close to the other.
It had been just what Elmer was counting on, ever since the tall chum
threw himself down as if carelessly; but nevertheless picking out a spot
where he could manage to get in contact with his leader.</p>
<p>“Sh! keep your voice down lower still; he must have the ears of a
rabbit—all these crazy people have!” Elmer told him, cautiously.</p>
<p>“Wow! do you mean that?” gasped the other, plainly staggered by what he
had just heard.</p>
<p>“Listen, and I’ll tell you about it.”</p>
<p>It took Elmer only a brief time to do this, for he chose his words, and
made sure not to add unnecessary details, leaving something to the
lively imagination of the other.</p>
<p>So Wee Willie had the scales removed from his eyes. He understood now
how the glib tongue of the cunning escaped lunatic had somehow dulled
his wits, and lulled his suspicions to sleep.</p>
<p>“Gee! so he’s that dangerous Gould chap, is he?” he murmured, as though
it might be difficult for him to grasp this amazing truth. “He sure had
me all balled up by his talk. My cousin out west’d say I’d been locoed,
and I reckon it looks that way. But ought we go to sleep like innocent
babes in the woods, with such a live wire in camp, and he a luny?”</p>
<p>“I don’t mean to,” Elmer assured him. “Some one ought to keep awake so
as to watch him, and I guess I’m IT in this case. Already Amos is
drowsy, even if he does know about the danger hanging over our heads;
and I’ve an idea you’d let yourself doze if put on guard.”</p>
<p>“Huh! try me, that’s all, Elmer,” whispered the other, a bit
indignantly.</p>
<p>“You can do as you feel like,” he was told; “but as for me I expect to
stay awake. And if he’s watching us right now perhaps we’d better break
away, or he’ll be thinking there’s something up.”</p>
<p>Amos tried very hard to keep his heavy eyes from closing. Time and again
he would nod and nod, and then with a start rub his knuckles into his
eyes; but presently the whole performance was renewed, until finally he
simply slipped over, and remained motionless on the ground.</p>
<p>Elmer looked at him with considerable compassion.</p>
<p>“Poor chap,” he was saying, under his breath, “he’s had little sleep
since we got up here, what with worrying about that wandering dad of
his!”</p>
<p>The camp was very quiet, save for now and then the snapping of the
flames as they ate their way into the log Elmer had piled on the fire.
Wee Willie had also tried to keep awake, and for a time seemed to be
successful; but in the end Elmer had reason to believe that he, too, was
fast succumbing to the sway of the slumber king, for he nodded
violently, and could hardly keep his head off his chest.</p>
<p>It must have been well on to midnight when Elmer noticed the first move
on the part of the “doctor.” The man was sitting up and observing them
with a steady gaze. Undoubtedly he was trying to discover whether any
one of his companions could be awake and in a position to notice what he
did.</p>
<p>Elmer held his breath, but did not move. He had so fixed matters that he
could see all that went on, though a crooked elbow shielded his face
from the betraying firelight.</p>
<p>Wee Willie breathed hard. He was fast asleep at last, despite his
positive assertion that nothing could tempt him to lose himself.</p>
<p>Now the man had started to get to his hands and knees. Elmer wondered
what he meant to do, and the possibility of rank treachery, such as
crazy persons are likely to display on the least occasion, filled him
with dismay. He felt a queer thrill pass through his frame as the man
arose stealthily.</p>
<p>Another minute would tell the tale, Elmer realized. Should the insane
man start to approach their side of the now half-dying fire it was his
intention to arouse his two companions with a shout, and spring to his
own feet.</p>
<p>Earlier in the evening Elmer, looking ahead to possibilities, had
managed to drop several billets of wood close to the spot where he and
his mates expected to lie. These would come in handy as clubs in case
there were actual hostilities, which he fervently hoped might not prove
to be the case.</p>
<p>He afterwards declared that it seemed to him his heart jumped up in his
throat when he saw the man actually take one step toward them.
Fortunately Elmer controlled his feelings, and made no move to betray
the fact that he was awake.</p>
<p>Relief swept over him upon discovering that the other had changed his
mind, if he really intended doing anything serious; for once more he
turned and crept away.</p>
<p>Elmer watched his receding figure as long as he could make it out. Then
it became merged in the dim moonlight, and their unwelcome guest had
gone!</p>
<p>Wee Willie, sound asleep, felt something grip him. He instantly started
to sit up, though only half awake as yet.</p>
<p>“W-what’s doing?” he muttered, unable to grasp the situation.</p>
<p>“I only thought you’d like to know he’s gone,” said Elmer, quietly.</p>
<p>The other was by now fully aroused and seemed to understand what was
meant.</p>
<p>“You mean Fe—er, the Doctor, do you, Elmer?” he demanded.</p>
<p>“No other,” he was told.</p>
<p>Wee Willie stared across to where he had last seen the recumbent figure
of their unwelcome guest.</p>
<p>“Glad to hear the news, that’s right; when did he slip away?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Oh! about ten minutes or so back,” he was informed. “I waited to make
sure of it before I waked you.”</p>
<p>Amos sat up just then.</p>
<p>“What’s this I heard you say, Elmer; that he’d quit us?” he demanded
eagerly.</p>
<p>So Elmer had to tell the story of his seeing the insane man get to his
feet, and how at one time he even feared the other meant to creep toward
them, which would have surely spelled trouble for everybody.</p>
<p>“But I’m glad to say he changed his mind,” he concluded, “and went away
peacefully; so I reckon there’ll be no need of these bully clubs I
managed to get together for use in case of a racket.”</p>
<p>“Gee! what a high old time we’d have had, if the fight came off,”
speculated the lanky one, with half a chuckle. “Some of us might have
had welts all over our bodies that’d spoil our whole outing. Yes, I’m
glad myself it didn’t happen that way. I don’t mind a class rush, or a
football tackle, but excuse me from battling with a crazy man.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m shaking hands with myself over the narrow escape,” Amos
observed, “and Elmer, I want to say right now that dodge of yours worked
like magic. He concluded he didn’t care much to stay over, and meet up
with his warm friends Collins and Andrews from the State Asylum; in
which I should say he showed a whole lot of wisdom; for they’d have
simply declined to let him wander off again.”</p>
<p>“But say, I’m a whole lot sorry about one thing,” remarked Wee Willie.</p>
<p>“Tell us about it then,” urged Elmer.</p>
<p>“Think of the poor chap going without a single bite for perhaps days and
days, ever since he broke out of the institution, mebbe,” continued the
tall chum, shaking his head sympathetically. “He said it was a whole
day, but I’ve got a sneaking notion it might have been a heap longer’n
that. If we’d had our grub with us I’d certainly have cooked him a
bouncing meal. He’s human, even if deranged, poor old chap!”</p>
<p>From which it can be seen that Perk was not the only member of the Camp
Fire Boys’ Club who had a tender heart, and was able to feel for any one
in distress, especially when hungry. Such a dreadful condition was
calculated to appeal to a boy more than anything else on the calendar.</p>
<p>“Well, what’s next on the program?” asked Amos, yawning again.</p>
<p>“I’d say sleep would be the most acceptable to some fellows,” laughed
Elmer.</p>
<p>“But would it be safe, do you think, with that crazy man hanging
around?” Wee Willie put out at a hazard. “They’re all mighty sly,
remember; and when he made out to walk away mebbe it was all a big
bluff. He might be meaning to creep back here like a red Injun, and take
us by surprise.”</p>
<p>“Then we hadn’t better all sleep at once,” suggested Amos, aroused once
more by this dismal prophecy on the part of the other. “Now since I’ve
had a few winks myself it seems only right I should take the first
watch.”</p>
<p>“What time do you reckon it is, near daylight?” queried Wee Willie; but
on putting it to a test by means of the little nickel watch, it was
learned that the night had by no means advanced that far; in fact it was
just twelve.</p>
<p>“Which means we’ve got about five more hours before the peep of dawn,”
Elmer was saying. “Now let’s make ourselves comfortable again, and every
one try to keep awake; but there must be no talking, remember.”</p>
<p>Elmer knew what the result would be, but he expected to keep on the
alert himself every minute of the time, and saw no reason for the others
doing likewise. And the result justified his confidence, for first Amos
fell off, and later on even Wee Willie’s nods as before became more
frequent, until finally his head lay on his breast.</p>
<p>Carefully Elmer managed to ease the strained position of the tall chum,
so that in the end Wee Willie was stretched out alongside Amos, and both
of them sleeping just as soundly as though snugly tucked in their own
beds at home.</p>
<p>It was a long, long night to Elmer.</p>
<p>Only his masterful will kept him awake through those dragging hours. He
heard the screech-owl whimpering to his mate; listened to the barking of
a red fox somewhere in the brush near by; knew when a ’coon scampered
out of the way as the fire, replenished with another log while all of
the boys were awake, snapped sharply, and threw out a sudden red glow.</p>
<p>Yes, it must have been one of the longest nights in all Elmer’s
experience, but when the first faint streaks of daylight began to appear
through the trees lying toward the east he felt satisfied that he had
not broken his word given to himself that he must not once waver in his
self-appointed task.</p>
<p>The insane man had not returned, but then there had been no certainty
concerning this. No one could tell what a mind diseased might conjure
up; and while they had treated Felix Gould in a friendly spirit he might
not be able to appreciate this, and even look upon them with suspicion,
as intending to hand him over to those who searched the tall timber for
an escaped lunatic.</p>
<p>And so when daylight came on Elmer, poor tired fellow, felt glad.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXX' title='XX: Once More on the Trail'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XX</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>ONCE MORE ON THE TRAIL</span>
</h2>
</div>
<p>At least the signs all pointed to its being a fine day. Elmer was glad
of that, for they expected to have their hands full finding Perk; and a
continuation of the storm of the preceding night must have broken up
their plans more or less, besides proving uncomfortable.</p>
<p>He was in no hurry to arouse the others.</p>
<p>“Let them sleep,” he said to himself, with a whimsical look on his own
rather peaked face; “they need it, poor chaps; and neither of them is as
used to doing without as I’ve schooled myself to be.”</p>
<p>So he moved about just as softly as possible while replenishing the
fire; and it was really the flames snapping that finally aroused Wee
Willie. He sat upright, and still rubbing one eye stared rather
sheepishly at Elmer.</p>
<p>“Huh! a fine sentry I’d make, I guess, to sleep on my post,” he mumbled
scornfully. “For five cents I’d ask some one to give me sixteen good
kicks.”</p>
<p>“Oh! that’s far too much hard cash,” chuckled Elmer; “lots of fellows
would be glad to do it for nothing, Wee Willie. But let’s forget our
troubles now the morning’s come, and our unwelcome guest hasn’t
returned.”</p>
<p>“Yes, one trouble seems to have skipped out; but there are others
still,” complained the tall chum. “First there’s Perk missing, and
nobody knows which way to look for him, now the trail’s all washed out.
Then the second thing that makes me sad is the lack of breakfast.”</p>
<p>He put both hands on his stomach, and grunted dismally.</p>
<p>“I guess it hasn’t happened but a few times in all my whole life,” he
went on to confess, “that Wee Willie has been forced to go hungry in the
morning; and I want to tell you right now it’s little short of a
calamity in my estimation. Why, I’ll be shaky all day long; you can’t
expect to keep the furnace agoing without stoking once so often.”</p>
<p>“But how about that cake of chocolate each of us took along, so as to
stave off starvation?” asked Elmer, maliciously.</p>
<p>His chum made a wry face.</p>
<p>“Well, you see chocolate may be all very fine in its place; but it never
can make me forget how much I love coffee, bacon and eggs, with
flapjacks to wind up the meal on. Now don’t think I’m scorning
chocolate, because it isn’t so; I’ll eat every scrap of my cake, and be
glad to have it; but oh! what an empty void there’ll be after I’m done.”</p>
<p>Amos must have heard them talking, for he now sat up and wanted to know
who had mentioned coffee.</p>
<p>“Thought I whiffed it brewing, for a fact,” he sniffed, making a wry
face, “but it was all imagination. Think of starting a whole long day on
a silly piece of chocolate; but if the rest of you can stand it I’m not
going to kick.”</p>
<p>“That’s sensible of you, Amos,” laughed Elmer; “though kicking wouldn’t
be apt to help matters any, it strikes me. Let’s sit around and talk of
our late visitor.”</p>
<p>“Yes, we’d like to hear more details about how he went away,” urged the
lengthy chum, as he clawed in a pocket for the square of hard chocolate,
which upon being produced he started to gnaw at eagerly as if the mere
thought of having no breakfast in prospect made him simply ferocious for
something upon which to “fill up.”</p>
<p>Elmer told all he knew as they sat there, waiting for the sun to appear
and warm the chilly early morning air, before thinking of making a
start.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m glad for one,” ventured Amos, “he decided to take French
leave, and it was all owing to your fine trick, Elmer, in making him
believe those two asylum guards were around here, and apt to drop in on
us any old time. Only for that he might be sticking to us as tight as
any old plaster; or the Old Man of the Sea who fastened himself to the
back of Sindbad the Sailor, you may remember, and refused to dismount.”</p>
<p>They were not long in making way with their scant allowance of
chocolate. Elmer knew that it would be of considerable benefit in
allaying the pangs of hunger; but Wee Willie could not forgive himself
for not fetching a supply of “real stuff” along.</p>
<p>“Shucks! we might have known we’d be out all night, and want breakfast
after a hard day’s work, and a night in the open, without even our
blankets to make things seem half-way cozy. Catch me doing such a silly
trick again—if I do I’ll eat my hat, believe me.”</p>
<p>“The Camp Fire Boys never make the same mistake twice running,” boasted
Amos, and then in a lower voice adding: “though they do have a way of
finding out fresh ways for doing the wrong things.”</p>
<p>“They’re only human, and you know what is said about it being the common
lot of man to err,” Elmer told him. “But if we make it a practice to
learn something every time we find we’ve figured wrong, well soon be all
puffed up with knowledge.”</p>
<p>So they chatted, often in a joking vein, as boys sometimes will on whose
shoulders troubles fall even as lightly as water on a duck’s back.</p>
<p>“About time we thought of starting out, isn’t it?” asked Amos, showing a
return of his eagerness, the others could easily guess why, knowing what
they did about his intense interest in the tramp whom their coming had
disturbed when in possession of the cabin at the Bend.</p>
<p>“Yes, for now the sun is up, and by degrees the woods will dry out,”
Elmer decided. “After such a drenching rain we’ll find every little
creek full to the banks, though they’ll soon lower again, I reckon.”</p>
<p>“What about my tuning up, and giving Perk the merry ha! ha?” demanded
Wee Willie, who apparently must feel in good voice.</p>
<p>“Whenever you please,” Elmer told him; “we’ll try not to be frightened
at the racket, knowing it’s only you.”</p>
<p>Wee Willie looked queerly at him, and then went on to say half
humorously:</p>
<p>“Huh! don’t know whether to take that as a compliment or not. Makes me
think of that fable of old Æsop about the lion and the donkey going
hunting in company, and coming to a cave where a flock of goats had
taken refuge. You see, it was arranged that the donkey should go inside,
and frighten the game out; while the lion would lie in wait, and kill
the goats as they appeared. Well, Jack went in and began to hee-haw, and
carry on something fierce; the goats came rushing out, and the lion got
his dinner all right. After everything was over the proud donkey
appeared, and asked his partner what he thought of his performance. ‘Did
I do my part well?’ he wanted to know. ‘Elegantly,’ the lion told him;
‘you made the greatest noise I ever heard; and in fact I myself might
have been frightened if I hadn’t known that you were only a donkey!’”</p>
<p>Of course both Amos and Elmer laughed, and Wee Willie, too, joined in,
for he was one of that kind of fellows who are capable of appreciating a
joke, even at his own expense.</p>
<p>Elmer showed his careful woodcraft training by making sure that every
ember of the fire was utterly extinguished before quitting the scene of
their night’s camp. He knew full well about the danger that always lurks
in a fire left smouldering by those breaking camp; for later on perhaps
a violent wind might arise that would carry the red embers into some
patch of dead leaves, and thus result in a serious conflagration. Tens
of thousands of acres of most valuable woodland have been annually
destroyed just through such criminal carelessness. If hunters and
campers would only exercise the proper amount of care, most of these
forest fires might be avoided, and beautiful timber tracts remain
intact, to delight the eyes of those who sought their solitudes for rest
and recreation during vacation times.</p>
<p>At last they got started.</p>
<p>Every little while Wee Willie would throw back his head and awaken the
echoes with a really stentorian whoop, such as might well have made an
Indian brave look envious. They always listened afterwards with a degree
of eagerness, in hopes of catching some return call; but time after time
it went with only a mocking crow winging its flight overhead uttering a
derisive “caw”; or else a blue jay scolding the invaders of its woods
haunt.</p>
<p>Elmer tried to figure out about what course Perk was most apt to take.
In so doing he had their recent experience to guide him; for he easily
remembered how the lost boy kept unconsciously edging toward the <i>left</i>,
as wanderers most generally do.</p>
<p>“I notice you keep on the watch all the while, Elmer,” said Amos; “while
Wee Willie and myself use our eyes to scan the woods on every side,
hoping to discover a sign of a moving form, or maybe a handkerchief
waving at us from some far-away tree on a rise, you scan the ground. Do
you expect to run across his trail again, where he started in after the
rain was over?”</p>
<p>“I can’t say I expect that, Amos,” he was told, quietly; “but it’s
always possible, you know. Perk must be somewhere within five miles of
us right now, if only we could get in touch with him.”</p>
<p>“It would certainly be a grand good thing if we did raise his track once
more,” Wee Willie attested; “we’d keep on like so many wolves chasing
their quarry, until we ran him down. But, Elmer, I hope we won’t have
any difficulty about making our way back to camp after we pick Perk up?”</p>
<p>There was a tiny vein of anxiety in the tall chum’s query; in fact, Wee
Willie was speculating at the time whether he could contrive to live
through the day with just that small cake of chocolate to sustain his
sinking energies. Already he began to claw at any berries he chanced to
see close to his hand in passing, as though the red Antwerps might help
him ward off the dreadful feeling of distress that came with “Nature
abhorring a vacuum.”</p>
<p>“I’ve got my bearing well in hand,” he was calmly assured. “Just as soon
as we find our chum you’ll see me head around, and I warrant I can take
you in a bee-line to our jolly old cabin.”</p>
<p>“That’s the right name to give it, Elmer,” agreed Wee Willie,
contritely. “At first it looked so forlorn and disreputable that any
style seemed to fit the outfit; and I guess I tacked on a lot of
sarcastic names such as ‘old,’ ‘shack,’ ‘shanty,’ and the like. But,
say, right now I beg pardon; that same cabin holds the wherewithal that
links my body to this earth, all our stock of delicious food, and for
that reason if nothing else, it’s going to be the ‘dear old cabin’ to me
from this time on.”</p>
<p>Elmer came to a sudden stop, and held up his hand.</p>
<p>“Listen!” he said abruptly.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXXI' title='XXI: “Toot—Toot—T-o-oot!”'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXI</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>“TOOT—TOOT—T-O-OOT!”</span>
</h2>
</div>
<p>Hardly had half a minute silently passed when a thrill shot through each
figure. No cawing crow could make that peculiar sound; no red-headed
woodpecker tapping at the rotten limb of a tree utter a scream of
similar import.</p>
<p>Elmer did not, like some boys would have done, immediately whirl
triumphantly on his mates, and say impressively: “What did I tell you?”
On the contrary he looked very happy as he simply said: “Sound familiar,
boys?”</p>
<p>“It’s Perk, all right!” snapped Amos, joyously.</p>
<p>“Yes,” added Wee Willie in a tone of absolute relief, as though a
tremendous weight had dropped from his narrow shoulders, “that’s the gay
toot of the old tin fox-and-geese horn Perk always makes a habit of
carrying around with him.”</p>
<p>“I agree with you, boys,” said Elmer simply, as he once again started to
“lead the pack.”</p>
<p>All of them became quite merry from that moment on. It was as though the
expectation of having their long quest rewarded by the discovery of the
lost chum filled them with supreme happiness.</p>
<p>Naturally the first thing that sprang from this condition of affairs was
a revival of reminiscences connected with that self-same tin horn of
Perk’s, now destined to have new glory placed to its credit.</p>
<p>“I remember how Perk always carries that old horn along with him
everywhere,” said Wee Willie, with a laugh. “Why, last winter when we
went in sleighs to country barn-dances, on the way home at midnight,
with the moon right overhead, and every fellow trying to get ahead in
the mad race back, above the calls of the boys, and the laughing and
shrieks of the girls when there was an upset, you could always hear that
old horn tooting like mad. Perk just couldn’t be happy without it. They
say he takes it to bed with him; and one night frightened his folks half
to death by sending out horrible squawks while in his sleep.”</p>
<p>That caused all of them to laugh again, for they were feeling decidedly
merry by now. Impending success always begets such a condition with
boys, who only see the present, or the immediate future, and do not
worry as to what Time may have in store for them.</p>
<p>“There was another story told about Perk and his horn that I remember,”
mused Amos. “Sounds almost too rotten silly to be true, and I kind of
half suspect some fellow manufactured it. But they say that last Fall,
in the thrilling football game between Chester High and that strong
eleven coming up from Bellwood when luck allowed our chum, playing with
Chester, to kick the deciding goal, while the crowd yelled like mad, his
old horn was heard above all the din; and they do say he had it with him
all along, concealed somewhere; but everybody laughs when they tell you
that yarn, so I reckon it’s all made up out of whole cloth.”</p>
<p>“Give him another whoop, W. W.!” said Elmer.</p>
<p>Gladly did the tall chum avail himself of the privilege, and this time
they felt a full confidence while listening for a response.</p>
<p>“There, that’s the boy, all right!” cried Wee Willie. “We ought to
congratulate each other on the success of our search, because the game
is winding up.”</p>
<p>“So is Perk, it seems,” chuckled Amos, in amusement, as other weird
blasts came to their ears, all from the same quarter.</p>
<p>Elmer changed his course just a trifle. It was like a mariner after a
storm adjusting his compass once more, now sure of his points, after
being able to take a reckoning during a burst of sunlight.</p>
<p>How different everything looked under the new order of things! No one
longer thought the woods gloomy, or filled with unknown perils; the
cheery sunlight breaking through the opening overhead seemed to cast a
halo over the aisles of the tall timber, making them look like fairyland
itself, such is the effect of impending victory on the human mind.</p>
<p>“I wonder if the poor fellow is nearly half starved at that?” Wee Willie
was saying, as he trudged ahead; for no one could think of a single
thing that did not have some bearing on Perk.</p>
<p>Amos was seen to tap his pocket suggestively, as though wishing to make
assurance doubly certain before speaking.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve kept his square of that fine chocolate carefully, and it’ll
be pretty refreshing, I reckon. You all know that Perk is wildly fond of
the stuff, and eats it by the yard, week in and week out. They say
that’s one reason of his being so fat.”</p>
<p>“Aw! they’re only joshing you, Amos,” chortled Wee Willie. “He comes by
that just naturally, you see. When Nature shapes a boy to be as round as
a rain barrel it doesn’t matter one whit what he eats, or how much, he’s
bound to keep on filling out. Just the same way if a fellow’s going to
be thin and scrawny, like me, f’r instance, you c’n stuff and stuff him
with every sort of fattening food; and, say, he keeps on growing
skinnier all the while. I’ve been through that thing, and there’s
absolutely nothing in it. I eat because I like my food, and not just to
try to pick up a pound or two of flesh.”</p>
<p>Elmer laughed as if amused. He knew Wee Willie’s principles of old, and
doubtless also fancied there was considerable of good hard common-sense
in what he had just said.</p>
<p>By now the blare of the fish horn was quite loud, as from time to time
it continued to well forth. Wee Willie occasionally sent out an
answering yell, just to reassure Perk.</p>
<p>“It’s going to make our work lighter if he keeps on tooting away,” was
his explanation for this periodical outburst. “If all of a sudden he let
up, why, we might have some trouble in actually locating Perk; because,
you see the woods are growing mighty dense around here. Such monster
trees, too; I don’t believe I’ve seen their equal anywhere about
Chester. Why, you’d nearly think you were out among those monster
redwoods of California.”</p>
<p>“There’s one that’s hollow,” observed Amos, pointing; “and what a fine
old refuge the big cavity would be in a snow-squall, for it faces the
south. A hunter caught in a big fall of snow could even have a little
fire going to keep warm by, if he took care not to burn his house down
in the bargain.”</p>
<p>“There’s one that must have been struck by a bolt last night,” suddenly
observed Elmer, with a touch of awe in his voice; for the wreck of the
great forest monarch was supreme, branches and splintered wood covering
all the immediate neighborhood.</p>
<p>“I’m glad Perk didn’t forget what he’s been told about such things, and
seek shelter in a hollow tree while a thunder storm was raging,” Amos
continued. “A poor chap wouldn’t know what hurt him, if he had been in
that tree, or even hiding under its sheltering branches, when the bolt
fell.”</p>
<p>Elmer turned a trifle more to the left. That last toot gave him his
clue, and he felt certain now that even though they should catch no
further signals from Perk’s fish-horn he could pilot the expedition
straight to the spot where the missing chum was awaiting their coming.</p>
<p>“Why, he’s right close by,” said Wee Willie.</p>
<p>“Given ten minutes more, and well be shaking his hand,” affirmed the
guide, positively.</p>
<p>“Good old Perk!” Wee Willie could be heard saying over and over, while
his freckled face fairly beamed with satisfaction.</p>
<p>It spoke well for the sunny disposition of the rotund comrade when his
mates displayed such enthusiasm over the prospect of once again coming
in personal contact with him. And it must be remembered that the
separation was only a matter of less than twenty hours; whereas from the
wild ebullition of their feelings one might fancy Perk had been gone for
ages and ages.</p>
<p>Perhaps in times past the queer sound of that battered horn which was
Perk’s especial delight may have jarred on the nerves of Wee Willie, for
it certainly produced what might be called a discordant series of notes;
but just now he reckoned them the sweetest chords he had ever known;
which only goes to prove the truth of that old saying to the effect that
“circumstances alter cases.”</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a startling movement, and some object broke from the
heavy brush to one side of them, dashing away with great speed; while
the trio of boys stood there as if rooted to the spot.</p>

</h2>
</div>
<p>“Hello! hello! Perk!” called the long-legged chum.</p>
<p>“Hi! there, Wee Willie! you’ve been an awful long time coming!” said a
voice so close by that it thrilled them through and through.</p>
<p>They instinctively started on a gallop, broke past a screen of bushes
that lay in a little opening of the timber, and there saw Perk, standing
with outstretched hand, and a wide grin ornamenting his glowing face.</p>
<p>Elmer actually threw his arms about the boy, he was so wildly glad to
see him once more safe and sound; Wee Willie, too, did not seem ashamed
to follow suit; while Amos less familiar, seemed satisfied to pounce
upon one of Perk’s chubby hands, which he started working up and down as
methodically as though he had been a milkman, as the tall chum said, and
was schooled in the method of adding to the daily output of the herd by
means of the barn pump.</p>
<p>Perk was laughing, even while his eyes showed plain signs of being
humid, so great was his emotion.</p>
<p>“Say, don’t squeeze me into a jelly, boys, please!” he breathlessly
protested, in mock seriousness. “Why, you’d think I was the Prodigal Son
come home to Dad’s house to help eat the fatted calf. And speaking of
<i>eating</i>, oh! have any of you got a crumb, or something to stay the
awful feeling of emptiness in the pit of my stomach?”</p>
<p>Amos thereupon dragged out the square of chocolate, possibly mentally
lamenting that he had been so greedy as to devour every scrap of his own
cake. Upon this fat Perk descended like a hawk, though the others were
more or less surprised to see him scrupulously divide it in exact halves
before consenting to put a particle of it in his mouth.</p>
<p>“Yum! yum! that <i>does</i> go to the spot!” he hastened to mumble, rubbing
his paunch with evident gratification; while the look in his eyes as
much as said: “The only bad thing about is the limited supply.”</p>
<p>“How did you put in the time while that storm was booming, we all want
to know, Perk?” Wee Willie was now saying.</p>
<p>At that the other grinned happily.</p>
<p>“Oh! I’ve had a wonderful time, all told, fellows,” he announced. “Since
I left camp I’ve been through a heap of adventures, believe me. No use
harping on a disagreeable subject, so you’ll just have to imagine how I
got twisted up in my bearings, and finally had to admit that I was once
more in the same old fix,—actually and truly lost.</p>
<p>“Then the storm caught me while I was sitting beside a little fire I’d
managed to make, for these days you know I always keep a supply of
matches on hand for just such emergencies. Well, it put my fire out in
short order, and there I was, getting soaked to the skin, and picking my
way along through the black woods, not knowing when I might run slap
against a hungry wild cat, or else that bear we saw up in the tree.</p>
<p>“After I got so wet it didn’t matter, I just kept moving about till the
storm let up. Then feeling chilly I began trying out the setting-up
exercises that they use in the army, which soon made me comfy again.”</p>
<p>“No use talking, you are improving, Perk,” said Wee Willie, admiringly.</p>
<p>“Oh! I’m getting there, by degrees,” the other told him, with a queer
look on his face that even Elmer could not understand; Perk seemed to be
cherishing a secret of some sort, which he was loath to impart until he
had piqued their curiosity to the utmost; that was all Elmer could
settle in his mind.</p>
<p>“But you’re fairly dry right now, seems like,” said Amos; “how did you
manage to do that, Perk, if it’s a fair question?”</p>
<p>“Fire, again,” chuckled the other; “nothing like it to dry you out; only
it did make me feel homesick to see those flames playing so merrily, and
me without a single scrap of grub to keep up my strength—that was really
the worst part of the whole business, boys.”</p>
<p>“But with everything so soaking wet around, how did you manage to get a
fire started?” demanded Wee Willie, incredulously.</p>
<p>“Huh! needn’t think you’ve got a foreclosure on all the woodcraft
knowledge that’s lying around loose, Wee Willie,” snorted the fat chum,
grimly. “Say, I’ve been taking lessons, and experimenting in some of the
ways you have for making a fire. I haven’t so far been able to bring a
blaze by means of a twirling stick with a bow to turn it; but shucks! it
isn’t any great punkins to knock some dry wood out of an old log, and
start it to going, if you’ve only got plenty of matches along; which was
what I did!”</p>
<p>Wee Willie whistled, to indicate his surprise. Really it was next door
to thrilling to know how the once dull Perk seemed to be picking up
points in woodcraft; even though he did persist in still getting lost
periodically.</p>
<p>“You’re sure a comer, Perk!” declared the tall chum. “Mebbe I’ll be glad
to sit at your feet and soak in wisdom one of these days.”</p>
<p>“No blarney or soft soap, please, fellows,” continued the other,
suspecting that they were only “joshing” him. “I hope I am improving,
that’s all; and that some day I’ll even learn how to find my way back to
camp on a bee-line. But whew! it was something fierce when that bolt
shivered one of the big trees not so far away. I thought for sure my
time had come, it sort of knocked me over, you see.”</p>
<p>“We had something of the same experience,” Elmer told him; “and can
understand how uneasy you must have felt.”</p>
<p>“Only,” added Amos, quickly, “Elmer managed to pilot us to where there
was a fine shelf of rock, under which we crept, so as to get out of the
downpour. We didn’t dare stay under a tree, with all that lightning
bursting around us.”</p>
<p>“I knew that too,” Perk hastened to explain, “and so I passed by a
splendid hiding place in a hollow oak. It looked mighty tempting,
though, when I first discovered it by a flash of lightning; and I had to
take a grip on myself to keep from giving in.”</p>
<p>“You certainly deserve a heap of credit, Perk; we’re proud of you,” he
was told by Elmer, which praise made the fat boy’s blue eyes gleam with
supreme happiness; Perk evidently considered it the highest possible
honor to be complimented by the one to whom he was accustomed to look as
a leader.</p>
<p>“Of course, I tumbled around a good bit while making my way along in the
dark,” the other frankly continued; “and I’m scratched up something
fierce; but it’s all in the game, and you won’t hear me squealing any,
boys. I’m only thankful it’s finished as well as it has; and mebbe I’ve
picked up a few points for taking care of myself in the wilds. Anyhow I
c’n make a fire, no matter how wet everything is around; and say, that’s
something worth while—for Perk!”</p>
<p>Again and again did he look particularly at Amos, Elmer could not help
noticing; and he found himself wondering why the new chum should engage
so much of Perk’s attention. There was also something most mysterious in
the way he kept grinning; Elmer knew Perk in and out, and could not
understand what the other had concealed “up his sleeve.” Usually
frankness itself, Perk must be practicing a new role to act in this
fashion, Elmer concluded. He would certainly bear watching, for he acted
as though hardly able to keep from springing some surprise on them.</p>
<p>“But you fellows are as dry as a bone!” Perk now exclaimed, as he put
his hand caressingly on Elmer’s sleeve; “so I reckon you either didn’t
get wet in the storm, or else have dried off since before a jolly
blaze.”</p>
<p>“Oh! we had a fire, all right,” mentioned Wee Willie, “and got dry in
almost no time. The blaze had a result, though, we didn’t figure on.”</p>
<p>“What was that?” demanded the other curiously, again grinning
mysteriously.</p>
<p>“Oh! it was seen by some one, and we found we had an uninvited guest,”
explained Wee Willie.</p>
<p>“Huh! you don’t tell me; now that’s some queer!” exploded Perk,
round-eyed by this time. “Who was your visitor, Wee Willie?”</p>
<p>“A dapper-looking chap who told us he was Doctor Hitchens, from over at
the State Asylum for the Insane,” said the tall chum. “He was a
wonderful talker, you must know, and fairly got me under his spell. But
fortunately Elmer here sized him up at his true worth. Whom do you think
he turned out to be, Perk?”</p>
<p>“Not—the—tramp?” gasped the other, incredulously.</p>
<p>“Shucks! no,” retorted Wee Willie, disdainfully; “who but that cunning
Felix Gould, the chap you may remember those uniformed guards were
looking for when they knocked at our cabin door the other night.”</p>
<p>Perk was seemingly much impressed by this startling information.</p>
<p>“Gee whiz! tell me all about it, Wee Willie,” he hastened to cry. “How
did Elmer know; what happened later on; and how did you manage to get
rid of the crazy man without having trouble?”</p>
<p>This was just the opening wedge for Wee Willie. He took the center of
the stage and proceeded to spin the whole exciting yarn; while Perk
stood there, his face expressing alternate awe and then amusement.
Several times when so far as Elmer could see there was no occasion for
such a thing he seemed to be overwhelmed with a wild desire to laugh;
which would end in a coughing fit, during which Wee Willie considerately
“held up” his explanation.</p>
<p>“What can ail Perk?” Elmer was asking himself, unable to understand such
unusual actions on the part of the chum who in times past had always
been frankness itself. “He’s certainly keeping <i>something</i> important
back, meaning to give us all a surprise. I wonder what it is. He’ll bear
watching, I reckon, Perk will.”</p>
<p>By degrees the story was told, down to the point where Elmer woke the
other two up, to inform them his little trap had worked, and how Felix
had taken himself off, unwilling to wait until those blue-coated guards
from the big institution run by the State came along to renew
acquaintance with “Doctor Hitchens.”</p>
<p>“Well, you did have a thrilling experience for a fact,” Perk blurted out
in his customary breezy fashion, when Wee Willie finally subsided. “I
should say it was a lucky thing he skipped out, and never tried to do
you any harm. Ugh! I was always afraid of crazy people; they make me
feel cold through and through. So I’m mighty glad he saw your blaze, and
not my little fire. Fancy spending a night alone in the woods with a
wild man, watching to see when you went to sleep, so he could mebbe
throttle you!”</p>
<p>“It was an experience none of us is likely to forget, for a fact,” Elmer
candidly admitted; “but we came through it all safe and sound, so we
feel as if we had a lot to be thankful for.”</p>
<p>“Now,” remarked Perk, presently, “if a stranger came to my fire, and
wanted to be taken in, I’d give him the glad hand; but all the same I’d
ask him for his credentials. It isn’t safe to believe everybody a friend
in these parts, Wee Willie. You think you’ve got a story to tell that’s
going to make the fellows down Chester-way sit up and take notice. Well,
I can match you, understand!”</p>
<p>“W-w-what’s that, Perk?” stammered Wee Willie; while Elmer nodded his
head as much as to say: “it’s coming out now; go to it, Perk, old chum!”</p>
<p>“Why,” said Perk, “you’re not the only pebble on the beach; because I
entertained a stranger at my fire last night, just the same as you did!”</p>
<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXXIII' title='XXIII: What Perk Did'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXIII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>WHAT PERK DID</span>
</h2>
</div>
<p>The tall boy stared hard at Perk when he made that astonishing
announcement.</p>
<p>“What! did he drop in on you too?” he gasped, and then added quickly:
“but you just said you’d be wild if a crazy man came into camp. Perk,
whatever are you giving us? It isn’t like you to yarn.”</p>
<p>“Oh! let me tell you,” continued the other, softly, like one who
delighted in making hay while the sun shone; it wasn’t often Perk had a
chance to whet the curiosity of his chums, and evidently he was bent on
making the most of the present opportunity.</p>
<p>“Wish you would!” grumbled Wee Willie, looking unhappy because he was
unable to see through the maze that confronted him, and understand just
what that smirk on Perk’s round phiz meant.</p>
<p>“To go back,” remarked Perk, reminiscently, “I had managed to build a
bully fire, and was getting nicely dried out. That was along about
midnight, I should say. The storm was past, and since the lightning had
stopped except away off in the distance, I wasn’t afraid any longer to
occupy a hollow tree I’d marked down, and under which I found my
wood-pile.</p>
<p>“Well, there I was, beginning to feel that life wasn’t so tough a thing
after all, when I heard some one calling. Oh! yes, it made me have a
funny feeling I admit, because there I was away off by myself, alone in
the flooded woods, with the trees still dripping, and the thunder
growling in the distance.</p>
<p>“But I could tell that whoever it was trying to attract my attention he
must be in some pain; and so I made up my mind it was up to me to start
out and find him. That was the time, boys, I wished I had a gun along
with me; for I remembered about that crazy man, and it didn’t make me at
all happy either.</p>
<p>“I went out, after fixing my fire so I could easy enough get back, if
nothing grabbed me. He kept calling, and soon I came on him, trying his
best to limp along. You see, he’d gone and sprained his ankle pretty
badly, and couldn’t bear to put that foot on the ground.</p>
<p>“That stirred me, I tell you, fellows. I tried to remember everything
I’d ever been told about sprains, and what was best to do for them. Come
to look and I found that it was a bad injury, with his ankle a heap
swollen; and, say, I bet you it hurt like everything; all of which was
especially bad for him, because, well for a good reason.</p>
<p>“I made him lean on me, and step by step managed to get the poor chap
over to my fire, where I stowed him on some branches I’d gone and
gathered and dried out with the heat. Then I took off his shoe, and
bathed his ankle with cold water from a little creek that was running
bank-full close by.</p>
<p>“He said he felt a lot better afterwards, but kept groaning every once
in a while, I didn’t know just why, except that he knew he’d probably
not be able to walk decent for weeks again. That makes some difference
to a fellow, I happen to know, because I’ve had a sprained ankle myself,
and had to stay out of school for three whole weeks, using a cane
afterwards.”</p>
<p>“Huh! that <i>was</i> a terrible time for you, Perk,” grunted Wee Willie,
“and ever so many fellows saying they envied you the chance. But keep
right along telling the details. Was he a dark-faced, wiry-looking chap;
and could he talk like a house afire?”</p>
<p>“Not my visitor, Wee Willie. I hope now you don’t think I entertained
that wild man, like you did?” Perk protested.</p>
<p>“Hardly possible,” said Elmer, “for he went away in the opposite
direction to this; and besides, couldn’t have been at our fire until
midnight, and then bobbed up away off here at the same time.”</p>
<p>“Just so,” continued Perk, sagaciously; and then went on to tell how he
had arranged things for the comfort of his caller.</p>
<p>Elmer already “smelled a rat.” He began to see which way the wind was
blowing, and could now understand why Perk had been casting so many
queer glances in the direction of Amos. There was a <i>reason</i>, and a good
one for this; and Elmer was now in a fair position to read between the
lines as it were.</p>
<p>“Now I know,” broke in Wee Willie after a bit, “why you broke that cake
of chocolate in two, and ate only half of it; you mean the rest for this
fellow you’ve taken under your wing, eh, Perk?”</p>
<p>The other nodded eagerly.</p>
<p>“I’m sure he must be nearly as hungry as I am,” he explained, “though he
said he wasn’t, and that he’d eaten a full supper last night, which of
course I didn’t. But it wouldn’t be fair for me to swallow the whole
cake, so I’m saving his share.”</p>
<p>“I believe you’d do the same for the worst scoundrel unhung, if he
happened to fall into your hands, like this chap with the sprained ankle
did,” Elmer boldly told him. “You’ve got a heart as big as a bushel
basket, Perk; and think of every one before yourself.”</p>
<p>“But how anybody could do different, I can’t for the life of me see,”
protested the other, simply.</p>
<p>By now Elmer believed he began to see light. Wee Willie, however, proved
denser, for he was still wrestling with the problem in his mind,
wondering who on earth it could be Perk had come upon so soon after the
storm, and whose injuries he had attended to as best he knew how, with
his limited knowledge of “first aid.”</p>
<p>Amos, too, was hanging on every word that was spoken. Apparently he had
also conceived some sort of plausible explanation for Perk’s actions.
When the latter found Amos so eagerly observing him, with that hungry
light in his eyes, he hastily turned his head away. Elmer wondered why
Perk did not seem to be embarrassed in any way, so he must conclude that
the other simply meant to enjoy their bewilderment as long as he
reasonably could, before lifting the curtain and disclosing his secret
to full view.</p>
<p>“It’s going to break right away,” Elmer told himself, confidently. “He
just can’t hug that much longer to himself. Besides, Perk never could be
cruel, even to an insect. Haven’t I seen him carefully step over an
ants’ nest many a time, when other boys would carelessly trample it
underfoot? And he’ll soon realize that in holding back he’s causing some
one to suffer.”</p>
<p>So Elmer did not raise a hand to hasten the disclosure, content to let
matters take their course. Wee Willie on his part now began to scent
some wonderful mystery.</p>
<p>“See here, Perk,” he broke in, with an assumption of severity; “you’re
trying to pull the wool over our eyes, for some reason or other, I
guess. Now quit your kidding, and show us. Where’s your friend? Produce
this man with the sprained ankle, won’t you, Perk? We’d all like to make
his acquaintance, don’t you know? Here’s Elmer getting as impatient as
anything, even if he doesn’t show it; and as for Amos, why he can hardly
wait for you to lift the lid. I’m in the same box myself; so lead us to
him, Perk!”</p>
<p>“He’s close by here, I want you to know,” explained the fat chum,
chuckling in his mysterious way. “Mebbe you’ll be surprised to meet up
with him. It might even be you’ll think I builded better than I
suspected when I answered that call for help, and ventured out to find
this poor chap.”</p>
<p>He was looking straight at Amos while saying this, though apparently
speaking to Wee Willie. Amos was as white as a sheet, and his limbs
seemed to be trembling under him, for some reason or other. There was
also a pleading look in his eyes that made Perk squirm, and feel that he
was displaying unnecessary cruelty in holding back as he did.</p>
<p>“Please, oh! please take us to him right away, won’t you, Perk?”</p>
<p>“That’s just what I’m going to do, Amos,” he replied. “So come along,
all of you, and meet my friend, the man who doesn’t expect to walk for a
whole month, because it happens to be his only good foot that’s knocked
out of business, since he’s lame in the other!”</p>
<p>Saying which, he started the excited boys on a bee-line through the
woods.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chXXIV' title='XXIV: When the Sun Broke Through'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXIV</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>WHEN THE SUN BROKE THROUGH</span>
</h2>
</div>
<p>“There!”</p>
<p>That was all Perk could say as he gripped Amos’s sleeve with a
convulsive hand, and pointed beyond. His heart seemed to be up in his
throat, threatening to choke him. But it was quite sufficient.</p>
<p>The man who had been reclining must have heard voices, for he was
already struggling to a sitting posture. Amos took one look. The face
was prematurely old, and just then wrinkled with physical pain; but the
eyes of love may not be deceived long. With a sobbing cry Amos rushed
forward.</p>
<p>“Father!” he cried in a choking voice, dropping beside the man, and
throwing both arms about his neck.</p>
<p>The other boys stood stock still. Not one of them but who felt himself
rendered dumb with the conflicting emotions that ran riot through brain
and heart. They saw the tramp push Amos back to look hungrily into his
eager face; and then despite the anguish it must have caused him through
that swollen ankle he almost fiercely squeezed the other to him, while
tears ran down his sunburned cheeks.</p>
<p>The boys turned their faces away, feeling as though it might not be
exactly a delicate thing for them to witness the holy joy that
accompanied this meeting between their chum Amos and the father who had
gone away seven years ago under a cloud, and whose family had believed
him to be dead all this time, because he had failed to communicate with
them.</p>
<p>Presently Amos called to them to come and meet his father. He seemed
almost transformed, such was the happiness shown on his boyish face.
Elmer could not believe it was the same sober-looking Amos whom he had
come to know; the long-borne burden had been taken from the young
shoulders, and thrown aside, never again to bow him down before his
time.</p>
<p>So in turn they shook hands with Mr. Codling. He did not look so very
much like a homeless tramp, Elmer quickly decided. Indeed, now that he
forgot his suffering in the great peace and joy that had come to him, he
seemed a very decent-looking and intelligent man indeed; and Elmer liked
the kind expression he could see in the returned wanderer’s eyes.</p>
<p>“First of all,” said Elmer, business clean through, “let’s have a look
at Perk’s work. It’s possible we may be able to better it; though I
reckon he’s done his level best.”</p>
<p>To this the injured man made no remonstrance. Indeed, he could hardly
tear his eyes from the face of Amos, who sat there beside him all the
time Elmer and Wee Willie went about their work.</p>
<p>“Tell me about your mother, boy,” the wanderer was saying, feverishly.
“How is Amanda; yes, and the little ones? Did she take you to her aunt’s
as she promised? And oh! I am shivering for fear you may have bad news
for me. I’ve stood a great deal, and tried to believe my punishment was
just; but I hope there is no break in the family—that all are yet
alive.”</p>
<p>“It’s all right, father,” Amos hastened to tell him. “And you’ll never
in the wide world know Kittie and Louise, yes, and Peter, the baby you
last saw. Why, just think of it, he’s eight now, going to school, and
mother says that every day he’s getting to be more like you were when
you first knew her.”</p>
<p>This affected Mr. Codling greatly, for his face worked convulsively,
though he also smiled through it all.</p>
<p>“Oh! if you only knew how I have suffered, son, all these years,” he
went on to say, “but I would not break my vow. They should never see nor
hear from me again unless I could wipe out the bitter past. But I am
grateful to know that while I wandered the country over, always trying
to rise above the level to which I had sunk, at least my dear ones have
not suffered from want.”</p>
<p>“Believe me, mother will go wild with joy to see you again,” Amos told
him.</p>
<p>The man, old beyond his years, looked pained at first.</p>
<p>“Do you think so, Amos?” he muttered, as though hardly daring to believe
such good news. “It will take a terrible load off my heart when I am
able to redeem the past, so far as a mere return of the lost money can
ever make amends.”</p>
<p>Amos laughed.</p>
<p>“Don’t let it worry you, father,” he hastened to say. “That was all
attended to long ago. Why, for more than six years now there hasn’t been
the slightest thing against you; and Mr. Hastings never let it be known
that he had lost a large sum of money through your fault. So you see
there has really been no publicity at all; in fact, these good chums of
mine are the only ones who know about it; and they’ve promised never to
let it go any further.”</p>
<p>“But—I’ve been expecting all this time that the money would be paid over
only through hard work on my part,” stammered Mr. Codling, weakly; “and
here, when I’m making my way back in the direction of my old home,
meaning to wipe out my error, you’re telling me there is nothing to be
done. Whose money was it that settled the claim against me?”</p>
<p>“Oh! mother attended to all that, sir. Why, I believe the very first
thing she did after her Aunt Letty died and left everything to us, was
to hurry to see Mr. Hastings in the city, and arrange with him to take
up his claim. So you see no outside assistance was needed; we took care
of things right in the family, father.”</p>
<p>“But—Aunt Letty wasn’t so rich but that this must have sadly crippled
your dear mother’s resources, Amos,” expostulated the man, suppressing a
groan that might have been from mental pain, though Elmer and Wee Willie
were gently handling his swollen ankle at the time.</p>
<p>“Oh! there was quite enough left, sir, to keep the wolf from the door,”
the brave boy hastened to declare, though Elmer remembered him saying
something that was quite different not so very long back.</p>
<p>“It is wonderful, simply wonderful!” murmured the wanderer, heaving a
sigh of supreme contentment, such as probably had not passed his lips
for seven long agonizing years. “To come back after this age and find
that God has been so kind, so forgiving as to leave me all my dear ones.
I can never be grateful enough to Him for these mercies. The hours will
seem like years to me until I can look again into her blessed eyes, and
hear her say that true love has survived it all.”</p>
<p>“If you knew how often she speaks to me of you, father, how many times
I’ve found my mother crying to herself after the children were all in
bed, you’d have no fear about that. Her one great dread was that you
might be dead, and we’d never know about it at all.”</p>
<p>“I can see now how cruel, yes, and foolish, I was to bind myself by that
vow, and keep from communicating with my family all this time. I might
have been saved much suffering, and spared her the same. But I believed
I had almost broken her heart by my folly, and meant to punish myself in
justice. A baffling Fortune gripped me, too; twice I was in almost good
shape to come back and clear my name, when a sudden shift swept my
savings away, and left me stranded again on the rocks.”</p>
<p>“But it’s all right now, father; and after we can get you down to
Chester, the town where we are now living, you will soon be able to walk
again.”</p>
<p>“That’s going to be a difficult job, I’m afraid, son,” said the other,
with a grimace, as though a pain reminded him just how badly off he was.
“You see, I’ve always been under a handicap, with that one short leg;
and now that the other is knocked out of business, I’m nearly helpless.”</p>
<p>“Oh! leave that to my chums here, father,” Amos cheerily told him. “They
are master hands about doing things; and I reckon we’ll soon be able to
make some kind of litter on which we can carry you every step of the
way.”</p>
<p>“How fine of you to say that; and how proud I am of my boy! I only hope
and pray that the bitter experiences through which I have passed may
always serve as a guide-post to you through life, warning you of the
hidden perils when once wrong thoughts find entrance to the mind.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile Elmer and Wee Willie had done their best to ease the pain. A
sprained ankle can be a thing of anguish, and its effects are often felt
for many moons after it happens; indeed, most persons would really
sooner endure a broken leg than such an affliction, since a fracture
mends much quicker.</p>
<p>They found that Perk had done very well, considering his inexperience;
his work was of course a bit bungling, though it had done wonders in
easing the pain, and also helped keep down the swelling considerably.</p>
<p>“We’ll keep you quiet while up here with us, Mr. Codling,” Elmer told
him; “and in a few days you’ll be in much better shape. Then, as Amos
says, we’ll manage to rig up a stretcher, and carry you all the way to
Chester; or else to some farm-house on the main road below, and phone
for a car to meet us.”</p>
<p>“Thank you a thousand times, Elmer,” said the other, earnestly. “You are
all splendid chaps, and I’m a fortunate man to find myself so well taken
care of. I shall be counting the hours and minutes until I can see my
family again; but with Amos beside me, to answer all my questions, I’ll
try to rest content. Surely I have no reason to be unhappy, now that the
clouds have rolled away, and the sun of peace is shining for me and mine
again.”</p>
<p>He smiled bravely, and Elmer had a faint suspicion there was a sparkle
in his eyes that meant something. Just as he formerly guessed that Amos
must be carrying a heavy and secret load on his young shoulders, from
his serious manner, so Elmer now shrewdly decided that Mr. Codling was
keeping something back, something which presently he would be springing
as a surprise.</p>
<p>“The first thing we have to do is to get back to the cabin,” Wee Willie
suggested.</p>
<p>“You’ve said it,” Elmer admitted, “and suppose you get busy with that
good hatchet of yours, so we can make a temporary litter.”</p>
<p>“Leave that to me,” chuckled the tall chum, who really liked nothing
better than to be thrown on his own resources, since it always served to
bring out latent powers which he had hardly known he possessed, as well
as wrought a sense of independence such as a progressive boy liked full
well to feel.</p>
<p>He began chopping at small but sturdy second-growth ash saplings growing
from the butt of a tree that had been thrown down in some previous
storm, and soon had quite a collection on hand.</p>
<p>“Now, if you’ll help, Elmer,” he observed, “we’ll rig up a stretcher
good enough for an emergency; though later on I’ll promise to better it
in every way.”</p>
<p>To this Elmer agreed, and they had little trouble about carrying out the
assignment. It was not a “thing of beauty, and a joy forever,” as Wee
Willie candidly admitted, but then they would only require it for a
short journey, and on that account it would hardly pay to go to any
great trouble.</p>
<p>They lifted Mr. Codling on to this. Fortunately he was a small man, so
the labor of transporting him would not be very great; and there was
Amos only too willing to “spell” either of the litter-bearers.</p>
<p>Elmer considered well before making a start. He wished to be absolutely
certain of his ground, since it would be too bad if they missed the
cabin, and hence lengthened their tramp. Wee Willie also figured things
out in his own mind; and from the way he wagged his head in
appreciation, after Elmer led off, it was plain that his judgment must
be identical with that of his chum.</p>
<p>Amos talked almost incessantly, for he had a thousand things of interest
to pour into the eager ears of his long-lost father. Mr. Codling never
gave even the faintest groan during the entire journey, though there
must have been times when he found himself jostled more or less, since
the trail was rough, and the slightest jerk would probably send a thrill
through his leg.</p>
<p>But his mind was filled with a peace that passed understanding. All the
agonies of seven years had rolled away. Once more he looked ahead to
happiness during the balance of his sad life. Only again and again
across his face would come a look of intense yearning, as voluble Amos
did his best to picture just how pretty Kitty, the twelve-year old girl,
was growing, so like her mother too; and what a smart scholar Louise had
turned out at school, a perfect genius, many said; while Peter, bless
his heart, was the dearest little chap, of whom any parent could be
proud.</p>
<p>It began to tell on the two boys after a while, but still they
stubbornly refused to let Amos or Perk take a hand.</p>
<p>“You’re doing your part, Amos, walking beside the litter, and keeping
your father’s mind taken up with all those splendid things,” said Elmer;
“because I know we must joggle him sometimes, and every little jolt
hurts a sprained ankle. We are getting along all right; and the cabin is
close by now.”</p>
<p>“I glimpsed the river through the trees just a minute back, anyhow,”
asserted Wee Willie, sturdily.</p>
<p>Amos looked at each in turn affectionately, Perk could see—Perk, who
kept hovering alongside the tall chum, hinting again and again that he
considered it “mean if they didn’t intend to let him take a turn too.”</p>
<p>“One thing sure, Amos,” said Mr. Codling, warmly; “you’re highly favored
in your pals, for they’re the greatest lot of boys I ever ran across!”</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXV</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>BACK AT THE CABIN AGAIN</span>
</h2>
</div>
<p>“Elmer, you’re sure a wizard when it comes to finding your way through
the tall timber!” cried Perk, presently; “because there’s our jolly old
cabin dead ahead. Why, you came as straight as a bee could fly to its
hive, after loading up with honey.”</p>
<p>“Nothing easier, once you get the hang of it,” laughed Elmer, pleased
nevertheless because he had hit it so accurately; while Wee Willie also
grinned, as though he considered that he also had occasion to pat
himself on the back, seeing that he had fully agreed with Elmer’s
deductions in the start.</p>
<p>All of them were delighted to see the cabin again. It may previously
have appeared old and dilapidated in their eyes, but just now they
forgot all that.</p>
<p>“Me to get a fire going,” roared Wee Willie, after Mr. Codling had been
carried carefully into the shelter, and placed on one of the rude
“springless beds,” as Perk called the blankets on the floor, under each
of which some hemlock browse had been placed so as to make things a bit
more comfortable.</p>
<p>“What shall we have for our noonday repast, at eleven in the morning?”
demanded Perk, almost beside himself with hunger.</p>
<p>“Better piece off with something that’s ready,” advised wise Elmer; “it
would take too long to cook things, in our near-famished state, though
of course a fire is necessary.”</p>
<p>“You just bet it is,” said Wee Willie, already bustling about outdoors
in gathering the “fixings” for a blaze. “I’m nearly dead for a cup of
coffee.”</p>
<p>“It will sure taste like nectar to all of us,” agreed Perk. “Well, if
the rest of you say so, we’ll postpone the big meal till later on. Guess
we’ll find plenty of stuff handy so as to take the edge off our
ferocious appetites; and that’ll give me a chance to lay out a spread so
as to make you sit up and take notice this evening.”</p>
<p>They were soon as busy as beavers, hastening back and forth, while the
injured man lay there and followed each one with his eyes. Whenever Amos
came near how his gaze would fasten hungrily on the boy! It was as if
Mr. Codling almost feared this might all be on a par with some of the
dreams he had had during his long exile from home; and that he would
suddenly wake up, to find himself back under the old distressing
conditions.</p>
<p>Presently the delightful fumes of boiling coffee filled the air, and
every one commenced sniffing eagerly, as though this excited them almost
beyond restraint.</p>
<p>“All ready here!” sang out Perk, in his cheery fashion; “gather round
the festive board, and get busy!”</p>
<p>Amos would not dream of eating a bite until he had fetched his father’s
breakfast to him. It gave the boy unlimited happiness to be able to wait
on the one whose homecoming he knew would make his mother feel so
joyous.</p>
<p>Presently all of them admitted they were a hundred per cent better off
than before; that “tired feeling” had vanished under the magical
influence of the Java; and the sandwiches which Perk made from bread and
butter, some cheese, and bits of ham which had been left over at their
last regular meal. Then there were crackers of several sorts, which
could be used to “fill up the chinks” as Perk put it; so that in the end
every one confessed that it was impossible for him to eat another bite.</p>
<p>Mr. Codling continued to smile at times in that queer way.</p>
<p>“Guess he won’t be able to hold it in much longer,” Elmer told himself,
“whatever it can be. Twice now I’ve seen him open his mouth as if to
speak, and then shut it again, with a little shake of the head. But it’s
bound to come out, and I reckon he means to give Amos a little
surprise.”</p>
<p>None of them felt much like doing anything of importance that afternoon,
for they had had so little sleep during the preceding night that they
were tired and heavy-eyed.</p>
<p>Perk, yielding to his special hobby, did go over to a certain spot on
the river bank, and fish for an hour or so during the afternoon; with
such good luck that they were assured of a fine mess of perch and bass
for supper. He set to work cleaning his catch, an operation which Wee
Willie did not attempt to interrupt. That was always a nice thing about
Wee Willie; when he saw that anyone felt really happy in doing a job for
which he himself had no great hankering, he would never attempt to ask a
division of the labor. And so Perk not only caught his fish, but made
them ready for the pan, and would in probability also do the cooking in
the bargain. There never was a more good-natured and willing chum than
Perk, as Wee Willie often told himself, with one of his grins; and it is
also to be hoped he fully appreciated those winning qualities in the
stout youth.</p>
<p>The supper was a grand success.</p>
<p>Perk “blew” himself for the occasion, as he called it, and really
prepared enough for two-thirds of a dozen instead of just five mouths.</p>
<p>“Huh! you never <i>can</i> tell in these queer times when you’re going to
have company drop in on you,” he remonstrated, when Elmer mildly
expressed his surprise at the enormous amount that came to their
rough-and-ready table. “Only last night you entertained one stranger at
your fire; while I had Mr. Codling pop in on me unexpected like. Then
remember how those two guards from the asylum came tapping, tapping at
our cabin door the first night we were here? So I believe in
preparedness. An ounce of prevention is worth more’n a pound of cure. If
anybody should step in, all we’ve got to do is to say ‘sit down, and
fill up, friends!’”</p>
<p>Nevertheless when the meal was through it was really surprising how
little had been left; for their appetites seemed capable of stretching
in a remarkable way, and Wee Willie acted as though he could never reach
his limit.</p>
<p>“I declare,” he confessed, after a fourth helping to the stew Perk had
concocted from canned beef, succotash, and some cold potatoes, “I’m
beginning to suspect my legs must be hollow all the way down, because
how else could I stow away what I’ve devoured?”</p>
<p>And after that, of course, Wee Willie might expect to have a deal of fun
poked at him in connection with his queer anatomy.</p>
<p>They ate supper inside the cabin, so as to be near Mr. Codling; though
of course such old campers as Wee Willie and Elmer, perhaps Perk in the
bargain, would have preferred sitting outdoors, so long as the weather
was fine, and the “skeeters” not too vicious.</p>
<p>At last, the tin dishes and cups had all been washed up in thorough
fashion, Elmer and Wee Willie insisting on doing that unpleasant part of
the dining program; though Perk protested that he always did like to
“splash things around,” and had even fetched a new dish mop along to try
out; but they elbowed him aside unceremoniously, the tall chum saying
commandingly:</p>
<p>“Here, you clear out, Perk! Think we’re going to let you have a monopoly
of this business? Guess the rest of us want to keep our hands in, don’t
we? You’ll be boasting, when we get home, you just ran the whole camp;
and we don’t want to get the laugh on us. Now forget it, and talk with
Mr. Codling. You know all his folks down home, and can tell him Amos
doesn’t overshoot the mark when he says little Peter is a darling,
ditto—Louise, and—yes, Kitty in the bargain.”</p>
<p>At that Amos had to smile, because the said Kitty was a big girl for her
years, and Wee Willie had been known to fetch her flowers, even a box of
candy on one occasion, when she passed her twelfth birthday; he also had
a tacit understanding with Kitty to “beau” her to the first barn dance
the next Winter, if her mother considered her old enough to attend such
jolly gatherings.</p>
<p>Mr. Codling waited until they were all gathered together later on, with
the “chores” completed, and the decks cleared. Then he spoke up, just as
Elmer had been anticipating would be the case.</p>
<p>“I’ve got something to say to you, Amos,” he remarked first of all; and
though his voice trembled, Elmer made sure that it was only through joy,
and not because there was any further cause for lingering regrets.</p>
<p>“All right, father,” the boy immediately said, coming to the side of the
speaker, and bending over; “I’m ready to tell you anything you want to
know, so don’t hold back. I haven’t got a thing to keep from you,
remember.”</p>
<p>“But this is something that concerns me, first of all, my boy,”
continued the other. “Listen then. You know I vowed never to come back
unless I found myself able to take up that terrible debt of mine, and
face the world again as an honest man. Yes, and I told you how twice I
slipped back after I believed myself on the road to fortune. Well, three
turned out to be the magical number with me, Amos; in Alaska I struck
rich pay dirt, and I’ve come back with all the money we shall ever need
again in this world!”</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXVI</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>LOOKING FORWARD—CONCLUSION</span>
</h2>
</div>
<p>No one said a word for a full minute, though Wee Willie and Elmer and
big-hearted Perk exchanged glowing looks, and happy nods, as if the
great news pleased them beyond measure.</p>
<p>Amos, with swimming eyes, bent over, and laid a hand on his father’s
shoulder. There was simple affection in the act, and nothing more.</p>
<p>“I’m sure glad to hear that, father,” he said as well as he could; “for
it’ll make you a whole lot better satisfied; but you’d be just as
welcome home if you didn’t have a nickel.”</p>
<p>“That’s the best part of it,” observed Mr. Codling, “and what makes me
so satisfied with the wonderful way things have turned out. But I
worked, and prayed, and in the end hit it rich, so that when I sold out
my claim in the new diggings I had a sum that was more than I ever
expected to realize, even in my wildest dreams.”</p>
<p>Taken in all, that was a most happy evening for them. How the sound of
those fresh young voices as they sang their favorite songs made Mr.
Codling shut his eyes and dream of past days, when he took Amanda Green
to singing-school evenings. Again he could in imagination hear her sweet
voice in carols of the times, as the scroll of the past was unrolled
before his mental vision.</p>
<p>“By all odds this has been the happiest evening I ever spent, barring
none,” he assured Elmer when, later on, they gave up singing and began
to make arrangements for sleeping. “In other days I never realized my
blessings half enough; but now that I’ve passed through the valley of
humiliation things look vastly different to me. Thank you again for the
pleasure it has given me to hear you sing. And I’m very glad my boy has
such a promising voice, because music used to be my one passion—in those
other days, you know.”</p>
<p>They were shy one blanket, now that they had a guest. Mr. Codling
understood how he had been given Elmer’s spread, and started to protest;
but he was speedily “sat down upon,” as Wee Willie expressed it in his
boyish vernacular.</p>
<p>“Elmer’s going to share my blanket, don’t you see, sir?” the attenuated
chum blustered, before his mate could say a word. “I’m so thin I don’t
take up half the room Perk here does. Besides, it’s summer weather, and
shucks! any fellows as used to camping out as we are don’t need to
bother much about coverings; this hemlock stuff is good enough for me.”</p>
<p>So it was arranged, and during the balance of their stay at Long Cabin
Bend Elmer and Wee Willie expected to share the latter’s blanket, which
fortunately enough was of unusually generous proportions.</p>
<p>During the night, after the late moon arose, and it was partly light
inside the cabin, Elmer, waking, saw Amos sitting up and looking
steadily toward the spot where his father lay. He could easily
understand the deep emotion that must possess the boy, as after a vivid
dream he was hardly able to bring himself to believe the wonderful thing
could be true.</p>
<p>So the night passed, and another day dawned.</p>
<p>All were stirring early, for they had laid out many things to be
accomplished between sunrise and the coming of night.</p>
<p>While Perk “wrestled” with breakfast, beaming with delight because he
actually loved to cook, Elmer took another look at Mr. Codling’s ankle,
Amos hovering near, eager to be of any service.</p>
<p>“It’s doing as well as can be expected,” was the comment of Elmer.
“These things are never over with in a hurry; it takes time, and a lot
of patience to recover from a sprain. If I was down home I could help
things along some by rubbing a certain liniment on, that’s the boss
thing for sprains. But you’ll have to make up your mind to keep quiet up
here, sir.”</p>
<p>“I suppose so, Elmer,” said the patient, with a sigh, “and I oughtn’t to
have a word of complaint. In fact, I’m too happy after having heard the
good news from Amos that my little family is well, to think of
grumbling. The whole thing seems almost like a page taken from a book—my
making up my mind to play the part of a tramp as I drew closer to my old
home, partly because I was afraid of discovering that something dreadful
had happened to my dear ones; and also because I did not know but that
there might be a warrant out for my apprehension, which troubled me more
or less.</p>
<p>“Then came the storm, and my misfortune, which I thought terrible; yet
it brought me in touch with Perk here, and finally the rest of you. Oh!
if only I had dreamed that Amos was one of your number, while I hung
around the cabin, waiting for a chance to recover my lost knife, how
gladly would I have made my identity known. But, after all, it’s come
out ten times better than I ever hoped for; and I’d be an ingrate to
complain.”</p>
<p>However eager he may have felt to be heading toward Chester, where those
dear ones lived from whom he had been separated so long, Mr. Codling
grimly resolved not to let Elmer and his chums see his distress of mind.
He felt that it would be a shame to cause these fine lads to cut their
camping trip in the tall timber short on his account.</p>
<p>But Elmer was revolving a scheme over in his mind, which he confided to
Wee Willie on the sly; and the latter as usual declared that it “filled
the bill to a dot.”</p>
<p>Without letting the others know what he was doing the tall chum busied
himself that very afternoon, away from the camp, making his stretcher,
on which the injured man could be carried out of the woods. Elmer
proposed that they leave their things in the cabin, manage on the
following day to get to some farm-house on the Crawford Notch road, and
either make an arrangement with the owner to take Mr. Codling to town in
a rig, or else ’phone for a car to come up and get him.</p>
<p>Of course, the devoted Amos could not dream of being absent when the
wanderer arrived, and so he would accompany his father, to enjoy the
wild delight that was sure to overwhelm the Codling home.</p>
<p>He could return in a day or two, if his yearning for taking flashlight
pictures still gripped him, which Elmer believed would be the case; and
so spend the balance of their vacation with his chums.</p>
<p>“It’s ten whole days till school takes up, you know,” Wee Willie had
remarked, when he and Elmer talked this over. “Plenty of time for us to
have all sorts of bully adventures. And if we think it a good plan,
while we’re down at that farmer’s place to-morrow, what’s to hinder our
laying in a fresh stock of grub?”</p>
<p>“Not a thing, that I can see,” agreed his comrade, nodding his head.</p>
<p>“Some of these farmers have heaps of good things laid away for winter,”
proceeded Wee Willie, who was hungry, it may be assumed, at that very
minute; “so, as long as we’ve got the hard cash still in our treasury,
after selling our stock of ginseng roots to that firm in St. Louis we
might as well do things up brown. We can fetch back a lot of fresh eggs,
mebbe a home-cured ham, several live chickens for feast days, and if
he’s got any <i>honey</i> Perk’d be almost tickled to death to have it to go
with his flapjacks; because, mebbe we’ll never have any luck locating a
bee-tree while up here.”</p>
<p>All of which goes to prove what every one knows to be a fact, that with
the vast majority of boys the best part of camping consists of the
“eats.” But in that respect boys do not differ greatly from those much
more mature in years, since the natural man comes to the surface as soon
as the primeval wilderness takes the place of civilized comforts.</p>
<p>When that night the subject was broached, Amos showed his sincere
appreciation for his chums’ consideration.</p>
<p>“This is mighty fine of you, boys,” he mumbled, thickly, at the same
time looking so very happy; “and you can bank on it I’ll hurry back here
to stay the balance of our vacation—after I’ve seen father safe home,
and just hung around a day or so to enjoy the situation.”</p>
<p>Mr. Codling tried weakly to protest, saying that he was already giving
them too much trouble; and that another day lost would cut into the
glorious time they had been anticipating; but they would not let him
proceed.</p>
<p>“It’s all fixed up, sir, so our plans can’t be changed now,” Wee Willie
assured him. “I’ve been making my stretcher on the sly, and I’ll show it
to you after a bit. Besides, the sooner we get you down home the better
for everybody. We can understand how wild Amos here is to have his
mother know the good news, and if we can manage it, you’ll both be there
by this time to-morrow night.”</p>
<p>The many things the boys had planned to do while in camp could wait
until their duty to Mr. Codling and their chum had been fulfilled. Amos,
of course, would insist on leaving his camera and flashlight apparatus
behind when he took his father home. In this way he would be drawn to
rejoin them later, so as to pursue those novel and interesting studies
of shy wild animal life which seemed to be taking such a firm hold upon
him latterly.</p>
<p>This program was carried out to the letter, for as luck would have it
the weather proved favorable on the following morning. They closed the
cabin again, and all started forth. Mr. Codling found the litter much
more comfortable than the rough-and-ready one upon which he had made the
trip from the big hollow tree at Perk’s woodland camp, to the cabin.</p>
<div id='i244' style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-left:10.0%; width:80%;'>
  <img src='images/illus-244.jpg' alt='' style='width:100%' />
<p class='caption'>Mr. Codling found the litter much more comfortable.</p>
</div>
<p>By taking things easy, and changing stretcher-bearers frequently, as one
or the other showed signs of tiring out, they managed to reach the road,
and later on a farm-house where the owner agreed to use his own old car
to take Amos and his injured parent to Chester.</p>
<p>The last Elmer, Wee Willie and Perk saw of them they were waving their
hands wildly from the “tin Lizzie” as the car started noisily down the
road leading to Chester, some twenty-three miles distant, by way of
Crawford Notch.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Perk, after they started back to the cabin, carrying the
supplies purchased from the farmer on the stretcher, “that winds up one
of the most thrilling happenings that ever came our way. As long as I
live I’ll never forget how I fetched him to my fire, and then discovered
that it was Amos’s long-missing dad. But it’s all right now, boys.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” chimed in Wee Willie, merrily, “everything is lovely and the
goose hangs high. Just to think of it, how bully things turned out, with
him fetching back a regular fortune with him, or papers to show he’s got
it in bank up there in Alaska, which means the same thing.”</p>
<p>“Beats any movie picture I ever stared at with goggle-eyes,” Perk went
on to confess, with his customary frankness; and then gave a sigh,
adding: “but it’s all over now, and I reckon the rest of our stay up
here will be just along the usual humdrum lines of camping. Still, we
have to eat, so I’ll have my chance for getting up new and novel dishes
to try on the dog.”</p>
<p>The others only laughed to hear him talk; for they knew Perk too well to
feel offended at anything he said. But, indeed, Perk need not have
feared a humdrum existence, if only he could have lifted the curtain of
the immediate future.</p>
<p>And if the reader feels any curiosity to learn about how Wee Willie
startled his camp-mates with a <i>mutiny</i>; as well as the strange series
of thrilling events that made their further stay in the wilderness
something never to be forgotten, all this and much more will be found
detailed at length in the volume that follows this, under the suggestive
title of “<i>The Camp Fire Boys in Muskrat Swamp; or, A Hunt for the
Missing ’Plane Pilot.</i>”</p>
